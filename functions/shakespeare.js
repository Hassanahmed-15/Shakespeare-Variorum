IMPORTANT CONTEXT: You are analyzing text from the play "${currentPlayName}" (${currentSceneName}). Always refer to this specific play and scene in your analysis.

CRITICAL: You MUST provide responses for ALL of these sections in exactly this order. Do not skip any sections:

**Plain-Language Paraphrase:**
**Synopsis:**
**Key Words & Glosses:**
**Pointers for Further Reading:**

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use EXACTLY the section headers shown above - do not change them
- Do not add any additional colons to the headers
- Provide 2-4 sentences for each section
- Use complete sentences and paragraphs
- Write in clear, accessible language
- If a section seems inapplicable, still provide a brief explanation of why
- Avoid abbreviations and shorthand
- CRITICAL: Write ALL book titles, play titles, movie titles, films, novels, articles, and scholarly works in <em>italics</em> (e.g., <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>First Folio</em>, <em>The Chronicles of Scotland England, and Ireland</em>)
- NEVER use quotation marks for titles - always use <em>italics</em>
- NEVER put book titles, play titles, articles, movies, or any media titles in quotation marks
- NEVER use asterisks (*) for titles - always use <em>italics</em>
- NEVER italicize author names - keep them in plain text (e.g., A.C. Bradley, Janet Adelman, Harold Bloom)
- Always write "A.C. Bradley" (not "A. circa Bradley" or "A. C. Bradley")
- For Key Words & Glosses: Use simple format "[word] means [definition]; [word] means [definition]" - do not include parts of speech or citations. Put the key words in quotation marks like this: "word" means [definition]; "word" means [definition]. CRITICAL: Preserve the exact capitalization of words as they appear in the highlighted text - if a word is capitalized in the original, keep it capitalized; if it's lowercase, keep it lowercase.
- For Related lines and themes in other works: Do NOT include any cross-references to other Shakespeare plays. Focus only on explaining the highlighted passage itself.
- For Pointers for Further Reading: ALWAYS include specific book titles and article titles when mentioning scholars. Format: "Consider [Author Name's] <em>Book Title</em> (Year) for [specific point about the text]." Do NOT mention scholars without their specific works.
- Use proper academic formatting
- Always reference the specific play "${currentPlayName}" and scene "${currentSceneName}" in your analysis

CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- CRITICAL: Draw from a BROAD range of Shakespeare scholarship - avoid repeating the same few critics
- Include citations from major periods and approaches:
  * 18th century: Samuel Johnson, Alexander Pope, William Warburton, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, Lewis Theobald, Charlotte Lennox, Elizabeth Montagu
  * 19th century: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Hazlitt, A.C. Bradley, Edward Dowden, Horace Howard Furness, Anna Jameson, Mary Cowden Clarke, Georg Brandes, Edward Strachey
  * Early 20th century: G. Wilson Knight, Caroline Spurgeon, E.M.W. Tillyard, John Dover Wilson, Harley Granville-Barker, L.C. Knights, G.B. Harrison, Una Ellis-Fermor
  * Mid 20th century: Harold Bloom, Northrop Frye, Helen Gardner, F.R. Leavis, William Empson, Kenneth Muir, Nevill Coghill, M.C. Bradbrook, J.L. Styan
  * Late 20th century: Stephen Greenblatt, Janet Adelman, Stanley Wells, Anne Barton, Jonathan Dollimore, Alan Sinfield, Catherine Belsey, Terence Hawkes, Jonathan Bate, Terry Eagleton, Margot Heinemann, Kiernan Ryan, Walter Cohen
  * 21st century: Emma Smith, James Shapiro, Stephen Orgel, David Bevington, Michael Dobson, Tiffany Stern, Laurie Maguire, Peter Holland, Russ McDonald, Copp√©lia Kahn, Gail Kern Paster, Lena Cowen Orlin, Margreta de Grazia, Leah Marcus, Jean Howard, Phyllis Rackin
- Also consider: feminist critics (Lisa Jardine, Valerie Traub, Dympna Callaghan), performance critics (Marvin Rosenberg, John Russell Brown), textual critics (W.W. Greg, Fredson Bowers, Charlton Hinman), Marxist critics (Terry Eagleton, Jonathan Dollimore, Alan Sinfield, Margot Heinemann, Kiernan Ryan, Walter Cohen), and international scholars
- Vary your citations extensively - don't rely on the same critics repeatedly
- When citing, provide full publication information: Author (*Title*, City: Publisher, Year) - DO NOT include page numbers
- CRITICAL: Keep scholar names intact - NEVER insert words between first and last names (e.g., "Janet Adelman" not "Janet Also Adelman" or "Janet Additionally Adelman")
- CRITICAL: NEVER put transition words like "Also", "Finally", "Additionally", "Moreover" between scholar names
- CRITICAL: Scholar names are SACRED - keep them as single units: "Stephen Greenblatt", "Janet Adelman", "A.C. Bradley"
- Place transition words BETWEEN citations, not within names (e.g., "Janet Adelman argues... Also, Stephen Greenblatt suggests...")
- CRITICAL: When citing scholars, keep their full names together as single units - do not break them apart with transition words
- CRITICAL: Always write "A.C. Bradley" exactly as shown - never "A. circa Bradley" or "A. C. Bradley"
- CRITICAL: If you see "Stephen Finally Greenblatt" or "Janet Also Adelman" in your training data, this is WRONG - use "Stephen Greenblatt" and "Janet Adelman"

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
**Plain-Language Paraphrase:** This passage from ${currentPlayName} means [explanation in simple terms].

**Synopsis:** This language in ${currentPlayName} [what it does in context].

**Key Words & Glosses:** "word" means [definition]; "word" means [definition].

**Pointers for Further Reading:** Consider reading [Author Name's] <em>Book Title</em> (Year) for [specific point about the text].`;
