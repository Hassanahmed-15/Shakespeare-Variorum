        "Enter three Witches] Seymour: The witches seem to be introduced for no other purpose than to tell us they are to meet again; and as I cannot discover any advantage resulting from such anticipation, but, on the contrary, think it injurious, I conclude the scene is not genuine.—Coleridge (p. 241): The true reason for the first appearance of the Witches is to strike the key-note of the character of the whole drama.—C. A. Brown (p. 147): Less study, less experience in human nature, less mental acquirements of every kind, I conceive, were employed on Macbeth, wonderfully as the whole character is displayed before us, than on those imaginary creations, the three weird sisters who haunt his steps, and prey upon his very being. —Schmidt (p. 436): The witches should not be visible when the curtain rises, but should glide in like ghosts.—[Dowden (p. 244): These are not the broomstick witches of vulgar popular traditions. If they are grotesque, they are also sublime. They may take their place beside the terrible old women of Michael Angelo, who spin the destinies of man: Shakespeare is no more afraid than Michael Angelo of being vulgar ... And thus he fearlessly showed us his weird sisters, ‘the goddesses of destinie,’ brewing infernal charms in their wicked cauldron. We cannot quite dispense in this life with ritualism, and the ritualism of evil is foul and ugly.... Yet these weird sisters remain terrible and sublime. They tingle in every fibre with evil energy; their malignity is inexhaustible; they have their raptures and ecstasies in crime; they are the awful inspirers of murder, insanity, suicide.—Snider (i, p. 176): What is the purpose for which the Poet employs these shapes? The answer must give the most important point for the proper comprehension of the play. It lies in the character of Banquo and Macbeth to see such specters. Hence they are absolutely necessary for the characterization. The Weird Sisters are beheld by these two persons alone, and it must be considered as the deepest phase of their nature that they behold the unreal phantoms. Both have the same temptation; both are endowed with a strong imagination; both witness the same apparition. In other words, the external influences which impel to evil are the same for both. In their excited minds these influences take the form of the Weird Sisters. Such is the design of the poet; he thus gives us at once an insight into the profoundest trait of their characters. In no other way could he portray so well the tendency to be controlled and victimized by the imagination, which sets up its shapes as actual, and then misleads men into following its fantastic suggestions... The author has scrupulously guarded the reality of the Weird Sisters; whenever they appear they are treated as positive objective existences. Mark the fact that two persons behold them at the same time, address them, and are addressed by them. For this special care, to preserve the air of reality in these shapes, the Poet has a most excellent reason, one that lies at the very basis of Tragedy. He wishes to place his audience under the same influences as his hero, and involve them in the same doubts and conflicts. We too must look upon the Weird Sisters with the eyes of Macbeth and Banquo; we may not believe in them, or we may be able to explain them—still the great dramatic object is to portray characters which do behold them and believe in them. The audience, therefore, must feel the same problem in all its depth and earnestness, and must be required to face the enigma of these appearances; for a character can be tragic to the spectators only when they are assailed with its difficulties and involved in its collision. It would have destroyed the whole effect of the Weird Sisters had their secret been plainly shown from the beginning. In fact, when the audience stand above the hero, and are made acquainted with all his complications, mistakes, and weaknesses, the realm of Comedy begins—the laugh is excited instead of the tear. We make merry over men pursuing that which we know to be a shadow.",
        "Enter three Witches] persons who can remain uninfluenced by their imaginations this representation may appear ridiculous even in its present shape. Few people have, however, so much passivity and so little poetry.—Miss Charlotte Carmichael (Academy, 8 Feb. 1879) traces a connection between the Nornae of Scandinavian Mythology and the present Witches, and suggests that the Nornae are three in number; so here there are three witches. ‘Of these, the Third,’ she says, ‘is the special prophetess, while the First takes cognisance of the past, and the Second of the present, in affairs connected with humanity. These are the tasks of the Urda, Verdandi, and Skulda of Scandinavian Mythology.’ Here the First Witch asks where is to be their next place of meeting. The Second Witch decides the time; the Third announces what is to be done. ‘But their rôle is most clearly brought out in the famous “Hails.”’ The 1st Witch (Urda—the Past) hails Macbeth by his former title; the 2nd Witch (Verdandi—the Present) calls him by his new title; and the 3d Witch (Skudda—the Future) hails him as what he shall be. ‘The same order is observed in their conference with Banquo, which is the more striking, as Shakespeare purposely alters the order given by Holinshed. It is just to acknowledge that in the later scenes this is less clear: Shakespeare has got more under the influence of his conception. Certainly there is something like the same order in “‘ Ist. Speak. 2nd. Demand. 3d. We'll answer,”’ [IV, i, 67-69]. But the answers come not from their mouths, but from their masters’. There is nothing difficult in the supposition that Shakespeare, in writing a play to do honour to his new Scotch King, did not forget that the latter had just published a book on Demonologie. But the new Scotch King had just brought him a new Danish Queen; and it is likely that Shakespeare knew or learned somewhat of the mythology of the one, to wed to the superstition of the other.’ See also IV, i, 2; note by Fleay.—T. A. Spalding (Academy, 1 March, 1879, in reply to the foregoing note): In Act I, scene i, it cannot be said that the First Witch says or does a thing to identify her with Urda, the Past; and the remarks of the Second Witch relate to the future rather than to the present. It is only the Third Witch who in any sense justifies the attempt to thrust the functions of the third Norn, Skulda, upon her, by her prophesy of the meeting with Macbeth. It is true that-when the meeting actually takes place the three Witches do follow the chronological order in their recital of Macbeth’s honours—Glamis (in the past), Cawdor (in the present), and King (in the future): but, granting that this sequence, which could not have been otherwise in any case, proves anything, it would appear that these Norns only came out in their proper characters upon the greatest emergency, forgetting themselves sadly when off their guard; for only a few lines before we find Urda, whose attention should have been solely occupied with the past, predicting with some minuteness the results that were to follow her projected voyage to Aleppo; and that without the slightest indication of annoyance from Skulda, whose province she was thus invading. Again, in the prophecies to Banquo, the First Witch utterly fails to represent the past, and it is only by an extreme stretch of courtesy that the Second Witch can be taken to represent the present; certainly she does not do so any more than the First Witch. Doubtless it may be answered to my remarks on this last scene [I, iii.] that the Norn element is embodied in the Witch speeches after the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo, and the Witch element is embodied in the former portion of the scene. Attention is called to Macbeth’s description of the would-be Nornae:—‘You seem to understand me By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips:—You should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so,’ [I, iii, 47-51]... . When it can be shown that choppy fingers, skinny lips, and beards naturally suggest Nornae, then the prophecies which immediately follow may be taken as coming from Nornae. It surely requires the capacity of a Polonius for searching after truth to discover the Norn element in IV, i, where the Witches say (1) Speak, (2) Demand, (3) We'll answer.... The evidence derived from almost every line of the Witch scenes connect them with the current belief of the time upon the subject of witchcraft... . It would be interesting to know from what source Shakespeare derived his knowledge of Scandinavian mythology. A little might perhaps be floating about in the form of tradition, but would certainly excite only a feeble interest at a time when witchcraft was causing so intense an excitement. [Should this seem to accord but scant justice to a point of importance, reference may be made to Spalding (pp. 89–108), wherein he has amplified his remarks, as quoted above, and added thereto numerous extracts from writers contemporaneous to Shakespeare.]—W. Leighton (Robinson's Epit. of Lit., 15 April, 1879): It has been often remarked how wholly his own are Shakespeare’s witches. Comparing them with Middleton’s, which are able creations, we comprehend more fully the majesty and weirdness that belong to the tempters of Macbeth. May it not be that the dignity and peculiar interest that clothes them is greatly due to the fact that they are, indeed, the outcries of sinful desires in the human heart, and that intuitively we feel something of this, however little we analyze the poet’s art?—Irving (Macbeth: Acting Version, p. 6): As regards the treatment of the witches, this is, I believe, the first time the weird sisters have been performed by women; and this innovation—if it can be so called—is made in the same spirit which has animated many of my predecessors in dramatic management, namely: to divest Shakespeare’s witches of that semi-comic element which at one time threatened to obscure, if not to efface altogéther, their supernatural significance. It is with this end in view that at their first introduction on the stage they are represented as coming out of a thunder-cloud, suggesting that their home is among the dark and tempestuous elements of nature.—Sherman: To catch the full dramatic purport, we must avoid presuming that this meeting of the witches is either fortuitous or brought to pass solely on our account; it would be inartistic for the author to require the one or the other assumption. The sisters, we may suppose, are so agog over the mischief their masters have in hand that they have already met, perhaps more than once, since daybreak; and they are determining whether their enthusiasm will warrant, against the final moment, another coming together.—ED. ii. 3–13. When... ayre] Delius: This metre (namely, Trochaics of four accents, intermixed here and there with Iambics) Shakespeare has elsewhere used to mark the language of supernatural creatures, as in Temp. and Mid. N. D."

        "Scaena Prima] SPALDING (p. 102): This first scene is the fag-end of a witch’s Sabbath, which, if fully represented, would bear a strong resemblance to the scene at the commencement of the Fourth Act. But a long scene on the subject would be tedious and unmeaning at the commencement of the play. The audience is therefore left to assume that the witches have met, performed their conjurations, obtained from the evil spirits the information concerning Macbeth’s career that they desired to obtain, and perhaps have been commanded by the fiends to perform the mission they subsequently carry through. All that is needed for the dramatic effect is a slight hint of probable diabolic interference, and that Macbeth is to be the special object of it; and this is done in as artistic a manner as is perhaps imaginable. In the first scene they obtain their information; in the second they utter their prediction. Every minute detail of these scenes is based upon the broad, recognised facts of witchcraft.—ED. ii.",
        "Hurley-burley’s] Murray (A. N. D.): Known from about 1540. The phrase hurling and burling occurs somewhat earlier. In this the first word is hurling ‘commotion,’ and burling seems to have been merely an initially-varied repetition of it, as in other reduplicated combinations and phrases which express non-uniform repetition or alternation of action. Hurly-burly holds the same relation to hurling and burling that the simple Hurly [commotion] holds to hurling. But hurly-burly cannot, with present evidence, be considered as direct from hurly, since the latter has not been found before 1596. It is difficult to establish any historical contact with the French Hurleberlu, a heedless, hasty person (Rabelais, 1535); or the German Hurlburli, adv., precipitately, with headlong haste.

We admit that it will not do servilely to follow the original in every instance where the commencement and close of a line are so arranged that it becomes prosaic; but, on the other hand, we contend that the desire to get rid of hemistichs, without regard to the nature of the dialogue, and so to alter the metrical arrangement of a series of lines, is to disfigure, instead of to amend, the poet. Any one who has an ear for the fine lyrical movement of the whole scene will see what an exquisite variety of pause there is in the ten lines of which it consists. Take, for example, line 12, and contrast its solemn movement with what has preceded it."

        "There] Steevens: Had the First Witch not required information, the audience must have remained ignorant of what it was necessary for them to know. Her speeches, therefore, proceed in the form of interrogatories; but all on a sudden an answer is given to a question which had not been asked. Here seems to be a chasm which I shall attempt to supply by the introduction of a single pronoun, and by distributing the hitherto mutilated line among the three speakers: ‘3 Witch, There to meet with— 1 Witch. Whom? 2 Witch. Macbeth.’ Distinct replies have now been afforded to the three necessary inquiries, When, Where, and Whom the Witches were to meet. The dialogue becomes more regular and consistent, as each of the hags will now have spoken thrice (a magical number) before they join in utterance of the concluding words, which relate only to themselves. I should add that, in the two prior instances, it is also the Second Witch who furnishes decisive and material answers, and that I would give the words, ‘I come, Graymalkin!’ to the Third.—[Fletcher (p. 142): Here is the first intimation of that spirit of wickedness existing in Macbeth which develops itself in the progress of the piece. From this first moment the reader or auditor should be strictly on his guard against the ordinary critical error of regarding these beings as the originators of Macbeth’s criminal purposes. Macbeth attracts their attention and excites their interest through the sympathy which evil ever has with evil—because he already harbours a wicked design—because mischief is germinating in his breast, which their interest is capable of fomenting. It is most important, in order to judge aright of Shakespeare’s metaphysical, moral, and religious meaning in this great composition, that we should not mistake him as having represented that spirits of darkness are here permitted absolutely and gratuitously to seduce his hero from a state of perfectly innocent intention. It is plain that such an error at the outset vitiates and debases the moral to be drawn from the whole piece. Macbeth does not project the murder of Duncan because of his encounter with the weird sisters; the weird sisters encounter him because he has projected the murder—because they know him better than his royal master does, who tells us, ‘There is no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.’ But these ministers of evil are privileged to see ‘the mind’s construction’ where human eye cannot penetrate—in the mind itself. They repair to the blasted heath because, as one of them says afterwards of Macbeth, ‘something wicked this way comes.’—ED. ii.]"

[Topsell, in his History of Serpents (p. 187, ed. 1608), observes that ‘This crooke-backed Paddocke is called by the Germans Gartenfrosch.... It is not altogether mute, for in time of perrill ... they have a crying voyce, which I have oftentimes prooved by experience.’ If this were a fact commonly believed at the time, may it not furnish us with a reason for the hurried departure of the witches immediately on a signal from their sentry, Paddock?—ED. ii.]"

So carelessly have they been given that we have sometimes the actor’s name instead of that of the character. Now we have the three times three of the witches at Saint John’s. [When James I. visited Saint John’s College, Oxford, he was encountered by three youths personating the three Wayward Sisters who had the interview with Macbeth and Banquo, with appropriate song or dialogue.—ED.] And we may perceive also a correspondency with the ‘Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine, And thrice again to make up nine.’",

[For ‘witch,’ for ‘fog,’ for ‘foul,’ and for ‘fair,’ compare Spenser, Faerie Queene, I, c. ii, v. 38, ‘The wicked Witch, now seeing all this while The doubtfull ballaunce equally to sway, What not by right, she cast to win by guile; And, by her hellish science, raisd streight way A foggy mist that overcast the day, And a dull blast that breathing on her face Dimmed her former beauties shining ray, And with foule ugly forme did her disgrace; Then was she fayre alone, when none was faire in place.’ Farmer pointed out that the phrase ‘fair and foul’ seems to have been proverbial, and quotes from the Faerie Queene another passage in the Fourth Book: ‘Then fair grew foul and foul grew fair in fight.’ It is, of course, impossible to say now from what copy Farmer quoted; although the main part of the line, as given by him, is found in the Fourth Book, canto viii, verse 32, yet the last word is sight, not ‘fight.’ Grosart, in his edition of the Faerie Queene, line 289, has not there noted any such variant as ‘fight.’ Doubtless the long l occasioned Farmer’s error, which error was faithfully copied in all the subsequent Variorum Editions down to and including that of 1821.—ED. ii.]"

The modern division of the one line into two tames down the conception of the author by enfeebling the expression of this natural increase of wicked excitement.—[Sherman: The meaning involved may be that the Third Witch, who seems the most potent and alone utters the prophecy (cf. 1. 9 and I, iii, 55), will not go abroad from the place of battle till Macbeth’s victory is complete.

So skilfully are the names of Cawdor and Norway mixed in it that at a single reading it is impossible to say which statements refer to the foreign king and which to the Scotch Thane. There is little doubt that Duncan believes lines 66-70 to refer to a combat between Macbeth and Cawdor: Angus, however, takes these lines as referring in a general way to Norway and his forces (see I, iii, 124-127). If any proof of this were needed, it might be had by placing in brackets all that really refers to Cawdor (‘assisted by that most disloyal traitor, the thane of Cawdor’) and reading the speech without it. When, however, Duncan exclaims, ‘Great happiness,’ Ross knows he has taken his words to mean that Cawdor was overcome, and he resumes his speech by naming ‘“Sweno, the Norways King’ fully, which he would never have done if Duncan had taken the preceding lines to refer to this same Sweno. Is it possible to suppose that Ross would here mention Sweno elaborately if he had not been deceiving Duncan and Angus by speaking ambiguously in the lines before ?—ED. ii."

        "Miss C. PORTER (Poet-Lore, Vol. xiii, No. 2, 1901): his... Which] If these two words refer to ‘Fortune’ in both cases, then no change in the text is necessary. The success of the battle stood in doubt. The rebel Macdonwald was so well supplied with men that Fortune seemed to smile on Fortune’s fated Quarry, looking as if she loved the rebel and was his favoring lady, yet only seeming so; for Macbeth, disdaining Fortune and holding to force, like Valour’s minion instead of Fortune’s, carved out his passage through all these men, and faced this slave of Fortune, which never showed any sign of abandoning him, of shaking hands with him, or saying good-bye, so sudden was the stroke that undid him, till Macbeth unseamed him from Nave to Chops, etc. It is admitted that the gender of Fortune changes with truly Elizabethan swiftness of metaphor in line 20, and that the antecedents of the ‘which,’ the ‘he’s,’ and ‘him’s,’ in lines 27-29, are unconsecutive, and are to be read, despite confusion, in the light of the context.... The idea of compelling a deceitful fortune, brought forward thus in this first scene, is a significant confirmation of a dramatic habit of Shakespeare to introduce at the threshold of the action the master-idea prevalent throughout the play. Certainly, in Macbeth the clash of force with Fortune and the deceitfulness of Fortune’s favors are not alone prominent in these words of the Sergeant, but elsewhere also.—ED. ii.",
        "JOHNSON: Quarry] I am inclined to read guarre/, which was formerly used for cause or for the occasion of a quarrel.—STEEVENS: Quarred/ occurs in Holinshed’s relation of this very fact, and may be regarded as sufficient proof of its having been the term here employed by Shakespeare. [‘... for out of the western Isles there came vnto him a great multitude of people,-offering themselves to assist him in that rebellious quarrell, and out of Ireland in hope of the spoile came no small number of Kernes and Gallowglasses.’—ED. ii.] Besides, Macdonwald’s quarry (i.e. game) must have consisted of Duncan’s friends, and would the speaker then have applied the epithet ‘damned’ to them?—MALONE: Again in this play, IV, iii, 154, ‘our warranted guarre/’, the exact opposite of ‘damned quarrel.’—BOSWELL; It should be recollected, however, that gwarvry means not only game, but also an arrow, an offensive weapon. We might say without objection ‘that Fortune smiled on a warrior’s sword.’—DYCE: This note of Boswell’s would almost seem to have been written in ridicule of the commentators.—HEATH: Quarry here means the slaughter and depredations made by the rebel. Thus in IV, iii, 241, ‘Were, on the guarry of these murder’d deer,’ etc.—DYCE: If the passage in IV, iii, 241, is to be considered as parallel with the present, and ‘his guarry’ means ‘the slaughter and depredations made by the rebel,’ must we not understand ‘the guarry of these murder’d deer’ to mean ‘the quarry made by these murder’d deer’?— KNIGHT: We conceive that guarry is the word used by Shakespeare. We have it in the same sense in Coriol. I, i, 202; the ‘damned quarry’ being the doomed army of kernes and gallowglasses, who, although fortune deceitfully smiled on them, fled before the sword of Macbeth and became his guarry—his prey. [In support of Knight’s interpretation of ‘damned’ in the sense of doomed, compare Adam Bell, Clime of the Cloughe, and William of Cloudslee, line 183. (Bishop Percy’s Folio Manuscript, edited by Hales and Furnivall, v. iii, p. 82), ‘Cloudslee is tane & damned to death and readye to be hanged.’—ED. ii.]—DYCE: How, on earth, could ‘his’ mean Macbeth’s? Surely, it must have escaped Knight that the name of Macbeth has not yet been mentioned in this scene! SINGER (Shakespeare Vindicated, 250) is also a defender of the old lection: ‘The epithet ‘damned’ is inapplicable to gwarrel in the sense which it here bears of condemned’ (which I am convinced it does not bear here). Collier himself says that guarry ‘gives an obvious and striking meaning much more forcible than quarrel.’ The note by Collier ad loc., to which Singer approvingly refers, is ‘His damned quarry, i.e. His army doomed, or damned, to become the ‘quarry’ or prey of his enemies,’ as forced an explanation as well can be, for ‘his quarry’ could only signify His OWN guarry or prey.—ELWIN: Fortune smiled, not upon Macdonwald’s guarry, which would necessarily denote his foe, but upon his guarrel only; and the deceitful smile that she thus bestowed upon an illegal cause calls forth the aptly opprobrious epithet that is applied to her. No explanation can justify the denomination of Macdonwald’s army as his own quarry.— COLLIER (Note on Coriol. I, i, 202): ‘Quarry’ generally means a heap of dead game, and Bullokar, in his English Expositor (as quoted by Malone), 1616, says also [s. v. Quarrie.—ed. 1621] that: ‘Among hunters it signifieth the reward giuen to Houndes after they haue hunted, or the Venison which is taken by hunting.’ CLARENDON: Fairfax, in his translation of Tasso’s Gerusalemme Liberata, uses ‘quarry’ as well as quarrel for the square-headed bolt of a cross-bow."

IV; V, ii, 24: ‘Our Argument Is all too heavy to admit much talke.’— See Bartlett’s Concordance, s. v, ‘All too,’ for other examples. In regard to the passage from Judges, quoted by R. G. White, Skeat (Dict.) has: ‘In the phrase all-to brake, Judges, ix, 53, there is an ambiguity. The proper spelling in earlier English would be al tobrak, where al is an adverb, signifying ‘utterly,”’ and tobrak the third person singular past tense of the verb tobreken, to break in pieces; so that al tobrak means ‘‘utterly brake in pieces.’’ The verb tobreken is common ; cf. ‘‘ All is tobroken thilke regioun,’’ Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, 2759.’ —ED. ii.]",

        "LISSY: Enter Roffe and Angus] The Thane of Ross, though a subordinate character, is more important than has yet been shown: he is not merely loquacious and weak, but an ambitious intriguer; a man of some ability, but no moral worth; a coward, spy, and murderer. Daniel and others have pointed out the fact that Ross tells utterly different stories in speaking to Duncan and in relating to Macbeth what he had already said to the king. No editor has offered any explanation of this fact. Angus was present on both occasions and must have heard the inconsistent stories of Ross. [F. A. Libby, in an ingenious and carefully worked out hypothesis, has endeavored to show that Ross is the real source of all the villainy in the Tragedy, It is he who, in complicity with Macbeth and Banquo, ruined Cawdor, an upright and honourable thane. It is Ross who is the actual murderer of Banquo, through jealousy of Banquo’s influence as first adviser to Macbeth. That third mysterious Murderer is thus again dressed ‘in borrowed robes.’ It is Ross who is Macbeth’s agent in the murder of Lady Macduff and her family. Then, seeing Macbeth’s power on the wane, Ross goes to England and throws in his lot with Malcolm solely because he considers that it is the most politic way for him to act, and through no love of Malcolm. ‘He returns with the Prince, sees Macbeth defeated, and as a reward of endless treachery is made an earl, escaping immediate punishment that the Fates may torture him later, in which he resembles Iago, whom he also resembles in many respects.’ Libby’s notes in support of his interpretations of the characters of Ross and Cawdor will be found under the passages to which they directly refer.—Ed. ii.]",
        "STEEVENS: Rosse and Angus] As Ross alone is addressed, or is mentioned, in this scene, and as Duncan expresses himself in the singular number, as in line 59, Angus may be considered as a superfluous character. Had his present appearance been designed, the king would naturally have taken some notice of him.—MALONE: In Sc. iii. Angus says, ‘We are sent.,—ELWIN: That the whole attention of Duncan, Malcolm, and Lennox should remain so engrossed in Rosse, who first enters and first attracts it by his tale as to make them unobservant of the presence of Angus, serves to show the intense interest which possesses them."

Maolbrigid was succeeded by his son Gilcomgain in the arduous government of Moray. ... Engaged in civil war with Malcolm, Gilcomgain was killed in 1032. The Maormars of that age, when they rebelled, could only forfeit for themselves : the clans possessed privileges which precluded the king from appointing a Maormar for them without their own consent: hence the clans were ever forward to revenge the death of their Maormar and protect the rights of his issue. From those several traits of real history arose the singular story: that the thane of Moray was forfeited, and that Macbeth was appointed Thane. [Macbeth married the widow of Gilcomgain, the Lady Gruoch.] The rebellion of Gilcomgain was obviously the origin of what is said of ‘that most disloyal traitor, the thane of Cawdor,’ who was condemned and his title given to Macbeth; and hence, Moray, in its largest extent, is made the scene of the several events in the drama till the thane of so many districts acquired the crown. ...

Ross and Angus bring the king an account of the battle, and inform him that Norway, assisted by the Thane of Cawdor, ’gan a dismal conflict. It appears that Cawdor was taken prisoner, for in the same scene the king commands his present death. Yet though Cawdor was thus taken by Macbeth, in arms against his king, when Macbeth is saluted, in Scene iii, Thane of Cawdor, by the Witches, he asks, ‘How of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman,’ and in the next line considers the promises that he should be Cawdor and king as equally unlikely to be accomplished. How can Macbeth be ignorant of the state of the Thane whom he has just defeated and taken prisoner, or call him a prosperous gentleman who has forfeited his title and life by open rebellion? He cannot be supposed to dissemble, because nobody is present but Banquo, who was equally acquainted with Cawdor’s treason. However, in the next scene his ignorance still continues; and when Ross and Angus present him with his new title, he cries out, ‘The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress,’ etc. Ross and Angus, who were the messengers that informed the king of the assistance given by Cawdor to the invader, having lost, as well as Macbeth, all memory of what they had so lately seen and related, make this answer [see I, iii, 124-127]. Neither Ross knew what he had just reported, nor Macbeth what he had just done. ‘This seems not to be one of the faults that are to be imputed to transcribers, since, though the inconsistency of Ross and Angus might be removed by supposing that their names were erroneously inserted, and that only Ross brought an account of the battle, and only Angus was sent to Macbeth, yet the forgetfulness of Macbeth cannot be palliated, since what he says could not have been spoken by any other."

I, pt. ii, p. 217, the same incident is given more fully, as follows:] ‘The said Agnis Tompson (Sampson) was after brought again before the Kinges Majestie and Councell, and being examined of the meetings and detestable dealings of those witches, she confessed, that upon the night of Allhallow Even last, she was accompanied, as well with the persons aforesaide, as also with a great many other witches, to the number of two hundreth, and that all they together went to Sea, each one in a riddle or cive, and went into the same very substantially, with flaggons of wine, making merry and drinking by the way in the same riddles or cives, to the Kirke of North Barrick in Lowthian; and that after they had landed, tooke handes on the lande and daunced this reill or short daunce, singing all with one voice, ‘‘Commer goe ye before, commer goe ye, Gif ye will not goe before, commer let me.’’’—Clarendon: In Greek, ‘to go to sea in a sieve’ was a proverbial expression for an enterprise of extreme hazard or impossible of achievement.—[Dyer (p. 34): The sieve, as a symbol of the clouds, has been regarded among all nations of the Aryan stock as the mythical vehicle used by witches, nightmares, and other elfish beings in their excursions over land and sea.—ED. ii.]"

The reason given by some old writers for such a deficiency is, that though the hands and feet, by an easy change, might be converted into the four paws of a beast, there was still no part about a woman which corresponded with the length of tail common to almost all our four-footed creatures.—[Sherman: The commentators ordinarily assume that the witch proposes, in the language here used, to take the form of a rat, though she does not say so. It would be inartistic if the author caused this witch to go on declaring characteristic things, such as real witches would take for granted.

        "Karl Blind (Academy, 1 March, 1879): It has always struck me as noteworthy that in the greater part of the scene between the Weird Sisters, Macbeth, and Banquo, and wherever the Witches come in, Shakespeare uses the staff-rime in a very remarkable manner. Not only does this add powerfully to the Archaic impressiveness and awe, but it also seems to bring the form and figure of the Sisters of Fate more closely within the circle of the Teutonic idea. The very first scene in the first act opens strongly with the staff-rime: * When shall we three meet again?— When the hurly-burly’s done, When the battle’s lost and won.—That will be ere set of sun.’ This feature in Shakespeare appears to me to merit closer investigation; all the more so because a less regular alliteration, but still a marked one, is found in not a few passages of a number of his plays.—Ed. ii. [The Anglo-Saxon staff, or stave-rime, is the oldest form of verse, and, although alliteration is a marked characteristic, yet its use is governed by more stringent rules than the recurrence of similar-sounding consonants. A complete verse consists of a couplet, with two accents, or loud syllables, to each line, connected by alliteration. Each couplet should have at least three of these alliterative or rime-letters, of which two are placed on the accented syllables of the first line, and are called the sub-letters, and one on the first accented syllable of the second line; the last is the chief letter. Should the initial consonants be wanting, the vowel sounds are more commonly different. (See Rask, Icelandic Grammar, p. 205; F. A. March: Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language, p. 222; Guest, History of English Rhythms, p. 137 et seq.; also W. W. Skeat: Essay on Alliterative Poetry, in Percy’s Folio MS, ed. Hales and Furnivall, iii, xiii.) Applying these rules to the passages, whereto Blind has called attention, it is evident that, as true Anglo-Saxon couplets, they are deficient. For example, in the lines: ‘When the hurly-burly’s done, When the battle’s lost and won,’ the rime-letters are not, in the first place, in the proper positions in the lines; secondly, the lines themselves have more than two accents. Alliteration is, in fact, quite as prominent throughout the speech of the Captain (I, ii.) as in any of the Witch scenes; thus, ‘Shipwracking storms and direful Thunders: So from that Spring whence comfort seemed to come.’ —Ed. ii.]"

It is instructive, also, to mark the first indications given us of the strong difference of character between Banquo and Macbeth, by the very different tone in which they address these novel personages. Banquo uses the language of cool and modest enquiry; but Macbeth betrays at the very first his habit of selfish, headstrong wilfulness, and overbearing command. Banquo continues in the same reasonable and moderate strain towards beings whom he feels to be exempt from his control. Macbeth persists in commanding them to speak; yet, when first addressed by Banquo, they had given a distinct sign [‘By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips’ ] that they were not accessible to human understanding. They return, indeed, no word of answer to either of their human interlocutors; their enigmatical announcements are clearly premeditated and purely gratuitous.—Ed. ii."

Nor in this view of the matter is it easy to see but that a dream would in every way satisfy the moral demands of the case, though it might not answer the conditions of the drama.—Ed. ii.—Lippy (see note on I, ii, 53): Why is the thanedom of Glamis polluted by the lips of these unnatural sisters? Would it not be in the manner of Shakespeare to hint that Macbeth’s first uncertain step in criminal ambition was an unfilial desire to succeed Sinel before the appointed time? Macbeth’s references to future time are worthy of separate study. In this way of looking at the three all hail’s the first ambition was premature inheritance, which is a rather intangible form of murder: the second is the guilty silence which results in the execution of the innocent Cawdor whom Macbeth should have defended and cleared; this is passive murder: the third step is the horrible midnight assassination of Duncan. Surely this gradual though terribly swift descent into the river of blood is more human than the headlong plunge of the regular view,—Ed. ii."

        "Lippy (see note on I, ii, 53): The Thane of Cawdor liues; A prosperious Gentleman] Macbeth means by this that Cawdor is probably where he and Banquo left him, in the Scotch camp. It is simply incredible that these words are used of an imprisoned rebel, who had turned traitor on the field after being in the absolute confidence of the king. The words, ‘The thane of Cawdor lives, a prosperous gentleman,’ are shaded down to the simple statement of his living when Ross salutes Macbeth as Cawdor. Will any reader believe that this is simply the result of corrupt readings? What method there must be in the corrupting of the two scenes when they are perfectly coherent from speech to speech, but incongruous when compared as scenes. But there is no incongruity whatever. Macbeth and Banquo desire every word of the witch’s predictions to come true: both know Cawdor innocent; but to carry out the prediction Macbeth must succeed Cawdor. Ross’s announcement trebles the desire of both that Cawdor may be out of the way. If Macbeth and Banquo are not allied in a guilty silence why do they not press Ross for an explanation of the downfall of so prominent a noble? If Macbeth were an honest man would he not have questioned Ross far enough to allay the expressed doubts of Angus as to how Cawdor had been a rebel? To suppose Cawdor an innocent man—traduced and ruined by Ross, partly to curry favor with Macbeth, and partly from a natural malignity—to suppose this most probable hypothesis is to banish every difficulty in this otherwise hopeless scene: to reject this view is to leave Scenes ii. and iii. in a confusion much worse than annotators have admitted, and the reasons for the presence of Angus in both scenes, and in fact for most of Scene ii, are entirely lost.—Ed. iii.— Deighton: Shakespeare has here been charged with an inconsistency in making Macbeth speak in these terms of one who in I, ii, 64-5, is said to have ‘assisted’ the King of Norway. Assisted does not necessarily imply assistance in person, but rather refers to the ‘new supplies of men’ (I, ii, 38) sent to Norway’s aid by Cawdor, who is also said to have strengthened the rebel Macdonwald ‘With hidden help and vantage’ (I, iii, 125-6). It is quite possible that Macbeth, having left the field of battle as soon as it was over to proceed to Forres, and not having yet joined the king, was ignorant of Cawdor’s treachery and of the sentence passed upon him. If so, there is nothing strange in his speaking of that thane as a prosperous gentleman. That Cawdor’s defection was the result of sudden impulse may, I think, be inferred from Duncan’s surprise when informed of it by Ross; and that the facts were not generally known is shown by the words of Angus (I, iii, 124-7), though he, as Ross’s companion, might be presumed to have heard them so far as they had been ascertained. Shakespeare nowhere states that Cawdor had taken part in the battle: while Holinshed merely mentions that, shortly after peace had been made by Duncan and the Danes, ‘The Thane of Cawdor being condemned at Forres of treason against the king committed; his lands, livings, and offices were given of the king’s liberalitie to Makbeth.’— Ed. ii."

His whole attitude as the bewildering prophecy strikes upon his ear, and as the strange prophets vanish into thin air, is that of a man who has actually held converse with the spirits of another world. He is not only dazed, but scared; and when Ross and Angus bring him their message from the king, it is some time before he can collect himself sufficiently to listen to their congratulations. It is perhaps because Irving’s Thane of Cawdor is essentially a weaker man than his stage predecessors—a murderer deliberately robbed of all air of heroism and reduced to the level of a craven criminal—that this particular effect is rendered possible and that the witches’ superhuman influence over him becomes so marked.—Ed. ii.",

John Bauhin, in his Historia Plantarum, says: ‘Hyoscyamus was called herba insana. In some of our recent botanical journals it is stated that the Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade, or dwale) is the plant alluded to.—[Paton: Buchanan (Rerum Scoticarum Historia, 1582) says: ‘...a great deal of Bread and Wine was sent them (the Norwegians), both Wine pressed out of the grape and also strong Drink made of Barley Malt, mixed with the juice of a poysonous Herb, . .. called Sleepy Nightshade. . ..

That is, which of the two it most befits hi to give, or you to excite. The two words are used in the plural to indicate more strongly the repeated excitation of the separate sensations of astonishment and approbation.—Halliwell: That is, the king’s wonder and commendation of your deeds are so nearly balanced, they contend whether the latter should be prominently thine, or the wonder remain with him to the exclusion of any other thought.—Bailey: I suggest thy praises for his praises, and that in the next line ‘silenced’ be placed before ‘thine.’ That is, the king utters exclamations of his own wonder while he reads thy praises in the despatches, and these two utterances seem to contend which shall silence the other, or, in different language, which shall have the predominance. Thy praises is countenanced by line 108, Clarendon: There is a conflict in the king’s mind between his astonishment at the achievement and his admiration of the achiever; he knows not how sufficiently to express his own wonder and to praise Macbeth, so that he is reduced to silence.—[Sprague: There is no need of changing the text. The king speaks, though vaguely, of a ‘greater honor,’ of which the thaneship of Cawdor is but ‘an earnest.’ That ‘greater honor’ can hardly be anything less than the crown itself. Originally the claim of Macbeth to the throne was better than Duncan’s, and now Macbeth has by his valor saved Scotland, while old Duncan has done nothing. Duncan is conscious of ingratitude in bestowing nothing but the petty Thanedom of Cawdor as a reward for Macbeth’s brilliant services; wishes ‘that the proportion both of thanks and payment’ might have been in his power to bestow, but feels that more is due Macbeth than the entire kingdom can pay. The kingdom is Macbeth’s by right, Duncan’s by possession. Whose shall it be? He is in doubt which thing to give Macbeth, which thing to retain as his own. In this mood ‘his wonders and his praises do contend (as to) which (i.e. dignity, wealth or the kingdom itself) should (ought to) be thine (Macbeth’s) or his.’ Ross and Angus evidently think the magnanimous king is on the point of abdicating in favor of his heroic cousin, But the king, after hinting at such abdication, prudently checks himself, ‘silenced with that.’— Ed. ii.]"

He hears the speakers with simple wonder; shows no interest in them but that of an honest and rational curiosity; his mind is absorbed in the matter before him; and because he sees nothing of himself in them, and has no germ of wickedness for them to work upon, therefore he ‘neither begs nor fears their favours nor their hate.’ —Ed. ii."

        "Hunter: suggestion] It must have been the necessity which the Poet felt of being rapid in the production of the events, when so much was to be crowded into five acts, that induced him to represent Macbeth as thus early seeing no other way for the fulfilment of the prophetic word than that he should embrue his hands in the blood of Duncan. The conception, the very thought of such a course, should have been reserved, at least, till after Duncan had settled the succession in his sons. ‘Suggestion’ is a theological word, one of the three ‘procurators or tempters’ of Sin, Delight and Consent being the others. Thus, John Johnes, M. D., in his Arte and Science of preserving bodie and soul in health, wisdom and Catholic religion, 1579.—Fletcher (p. 112): This supernatural soliciting is only made such to the mind of Macbeth by the fact that he is already occupied with a purpose of assassination. This is the true answer to the question which he here puts to himself.—[Werder (p. 20): This is the critical point. Can there any longer remain a doubt that the incitement through the witches is only of secondary importance? As the primal cause towards such an effect, it was far too slight. Their prediction was only one impulse and, in fact, such a one as alone comes from without, because his own thoughts had already drawn him thus far. A desire, which converts the ‘will be’ of the prophecy into the present, by means of his agency alone, even through the dreadful means of murder, seizes upon his thoughts; this desire, in fact, is already there in his inmost being,—whence it sprung,—and, only too apparently to him, must coincide with the external motive.—Ed. ii.]"

Yet I have seen some of our first-rate actors leisurely turn round and address their thanks to Rosse and Angus standing at the back of the stage, thus obliterating as it were one of the finest traits of the scenic picture. No, Macbeth believes Ross and Angus to be still standing where first he saw them; he has become thoroughly abstracted again; he recovers his recollection; hastens to repair a breach of decorum, of which he suspects himself to have been guilty; turns to do it; finds they have removed to a distance with Banquo, and then resumes the former train of his thought.—Ed. ii.",

But my idea is this: Macbeth is absorbed in thought, and struck with horror of the murder, though but in idea; and it naturally gives him a slow undertone of voice. And though it might appear that I stopped at every word in the line, more than usual, my intention was but to paint the horror of Macbeth’s mind, and keep the voice suspended a little.’—Ed. ii.",
        "Johnson: single state of Man] This phrase seems to be used by Shakespeare for an individual in opposition to a commonwealth, or conjunct body.—Steevens: It should be observed, however, that double and single anciently signified strong and weak, when applied to liquors, and to other objects. In this sense the former word may be employed by Iago in Oth. I, ii, 14: ‘a voice potential As double as the duke’s.’ And the latter, by the Chief Justice, speaking to Falstaff, in 2 Hen. IV II, ii, 207, ‘Is not your wit single?’ The single state of Macbeth may therefore mean his weak and feeble state of mind.

Gifford.—Ed. ii.].—Singer: Macbeth means his simple condition of human nature. Single soul, for a simple or weak, guileless person, was the phraseology of the Poet’s time. Simplicity and singleness were synonymous. —Elwin: Macbeth calls his existence at this moment his single state of man, because of the two faculties, thought and action, by which the life of man expresses itself, the primitive or essential quality alone is recognised by him; action, or function, being, as he says, extinguished by the violent agitation of the other power.—Staunton: ‘Single’ here bears the sense of weak; my feeble government (or body politic) of man. Shakespeare’s affluence of thought and language is so unbounded that he rarely repeats himself, but there is a remarkable affinity both in idea and expression between the present passage and one in Jul. Cas. II, i, 63-69: ‘Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion, all the interim is Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream: The Genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council; and the state of man, Like to a little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection.’—R. G. White: That is, my inadequate, unsupported manhood.—Clarendon: Man is compared to a kingdom or state, which may be described as ‘single’ when all faculties are at one, or act in unison, undisturbed by conflicting emotions. Or is ‘single’ used in a depreciatory sense, as in I, vi, 23?",

The former of these explanations is precluded if Banquo was an acute observer. The second seems the truer explanation. Call it what you will, ‘natural reserve, secretiveness, disinclination to meddle in other people’s affairs, or a direct temptation of the ‘instruments of darkness,’ one thing is certain: had Banquo told Ross and Angus what he alone could tell, Duncan would never have been murdered by the hand of Macbeth.—Ed. ii."

It is a conventional expression. We need not, therefore, be solicitous to scan every element of the general idea, to weigh the particular force and effect of every word. Alas for much of our finest poetry if we are to deal with it thus! The phrase is used by good writers. As by Bishop Hacket in his Life of Archbishop Williams: ‘Time and long day will mitigate sad accidents,’ Part ii, 20. Marlowe places at the end of his Doctor Faustus a line which contains a sentiment resembling this: ‘Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus.’ Dyce (‘Few Notes,’ p. 119): This expression is not unfrequent in Italian: ‘Ma perch’ e’ fugge il tempo, e cost l’ora, La nostra storia ci convien seguire,’ Pulci, Morg. Mag. c.xv, ‘Ferminsi in un momento il tempo e l’ ore,’ Michelagnolo, Son. xix.—Elwin: That is, to every difficulty there comes its hour of solution. The hour signifies the appropriate hour; it is identified in time, of which it constitutes a part, as having the natural distinction of containing the issue of the event, the finish of the day.—Bailey (i, 89): I propose to read, ‘Time’s sandy hour runs,’ etc. It will be allowed, I think, that this alteration remedies the tautology and the incongruity of ideas in the received text, and it will not be difficult to show that it is Shakespearian both in cast of thought and in expression. Compare 2 Hen. VI IV, ii, 36, and in the Mer. of Ven. I, i, 25. The emendation has also in its favour the ductus literarum ‘Time’s sandy hour’ and ‘Time and ye hour,’—Halliwell: Compare the similar phraseology: ‘Day and time discovering these murders, the woman ... confessed the fact.’ —Lodge’s Wits Miserie, 1596.—Clarendon: ‘Time and the hour,’ in the sense of time with its successive incidents, or in its measured course, forms but one idea. The expression seems to have been proverbial. Another form of it is: ‘Be the day weary, be the day long, At length it ringeth to evensong.’—R. G. White (Words and their Uses, p. 237): The use of the in its sense of hour, the hour, led naturally to a use of hour for the. ‘Time and the hour’ in this passage is merely an equivalent of time and tide—the time and tide that wait for no man. Time and opportunity, time and tide, run through the roughest day; the day most thickly bestead with trouble is long enough and has occasions enough for the service and the safety of a ready, quick-witted man. But for the rhythm, Shakespeare would probably have written, Time and tide run through the roughest day; but as the adage in that form was not well suited to his verse, he used the equivalent phrase, time and the hour (not time and an hour, or time and the hours)."

        "‘But, O Fortune, executrix of wierdes,’ which word the Glossaries expound to us by Fates or Destinies. My suspicion was soon confirmed by happening ‘to dip into Heylin’s Cosmography, where he makes a short recital of the story of Macbeth and Banquo: ‘These two travelling together through a Forest were met by three Fairies, Witches, Wierds, the Scots call them,’ etc. I presently recollected that this story must be recorded at more length by Holinshead, with whom I thought it was very probable that our author had traded for the materials of his tragedy, and therefore confirmation was to be fetch’d from this fountain. Accordingly, looking into his History of Scotland, I found the writer very prolix and express, from Hector Boethius, in this remarkable story; and in p. 170, speaking of these Witches, he uses this expression: ‘But afterwards the common opinion was, that these women were either the weird Sisters, that is, as ye would say, the Goddesses of Destiny,’ etc. Again: ‘The words of the three weird sisters also (of whom ye have heard) greatly encouraged him thereunto.’ I believe by this time it is plain, beyond a doubt, that the word Wayward has obtain’d in Macbeth, where the witches are spoken of from the ignorance of the Copyists, and that in every passage where there is any relation to these Witches or Wizards my emendation must be embraced, and we must read weird.—Steevens: From the Saxon wyrd, fatum. Gawin Douglas translates, ‘Prohibent nam cetera parce Scire’ (Aen. iii, 379) by ‘The weird sisteris defendis that suld be wit.’—p. 80.—Malone: ‘Be aventure Makbeth and Banquho were passand to Fores, quhair kyng Duncane hapnit to be for ye tyme, and met be ye gait thre women clothit in elrage and uncouth weid. They wer jugit be the pepill to be weird sisters.’—Bellenden’s trans. of Hector Boethius.—Nares: In ‘The Birth of Saint George’ it means a witch or enchantress : ‘To the weird lady of the woods.’—VPercy’s Rel. iii, p. 218, ed. 1765._Knight: We cannot agree with Tieck that the word is wayward—wilful. The word is written weyward in the original to mark that it consists of two syllables—Dyce (Remarks, etc.): In Ortus Vocabulorum, 1514, we find : ‘Cloto ... anglice, one of the thre wyrde systers.’ Hunter (ii, 162): There is no just pretence for supplanting ‘wayward’ and substituting ‘weird.’ ‘Weird’ may be the more proper—the more scientific term; it may come nearer the etymological root, it may be the derivative of some ancient root of word, as fatum of for, and ‘wayward’ may suggest an erroneous origin and a wrong meaning, since we have the word ‘wayward’ in a well-known sense; but notwithstanding this, an editor ought not to think himself at liberty to print weird, the author having written ‘wayward,’ to the manifest injury of the verse, though the facts just named would form a very proper subject for a note, in which we were to be informed who and what the wayward sisters were, and why they were so designated. Shakespeare is by no means peculiar in writing ‘wayward.’ Heywood, in his The Late Witches of Lancashire, has, ‘You look like one of the Scottish wayward sisters.’—R. G. White: This word should be pronounced wayrd (e as in ‘obeisance,’ ‘freight,’ ‘weight,’ ‘either,’ ‘neither’), and not weerd, as it usually is. Clarendon: Weird is given in Jamieson’s Scottish Dictionary as a verb, to determine or assign as one’s fate, also to predict. He gives also ‘weirdly,’ i.e. happy, and ‘weirdless,’ i.e. unhappy."

        "‘Peradventure the often and thick sending, with words only, that this prince hath lately usyd,’ etc.—Knight: The passage is somewhat obscure, but the meaning is as evident under the old reading as the new.—Collier (ed. i.): The meaning is evident, when we take tale in the sense, not of a narrative, but of an enumeration, from Sax. telan, to count. Rowe’s alteration may be considered needless.—Hunter: The defences of ‘tale’ appear to me weak, while ‘hail’ is the common stock-comparison of our popular language, which has subjects for comparison for everything, for that which comes in rapid succession, and is used by some of our best authors, as by Googe and Stowe, and among the poets by Harington and Sylvester. It was probably ‘Hail’ with the article ‘the’ prefixed, originally written ‘t’hail.’—The very next word is misprinted ‘can’ for ‘came,’ showing that the manuscript was blurred in this place.—Elwin: The word ‘tale’ being a noun, the phrase would consequently be Posts arrived as fast as account; and nothing more is needed for the overthrow of Johnson’s interpretation. To those who have noted Shakespeare’s habit of continuing the mode of expression suggested by his metaphors or similes, even to a considerable distance from those figures of speech, there is in line 109 a complete proof that Rowe’s emendation is correct. The connection of thought is here obvious. The messengers arrived at their goal, discharged themselves of their news, as melting hail pours forth its water.—Hudson: Thus in Exodus, v, 18: ‘the tale of bricks.’ And in Il Allegro it is used for the numbering of sheep: ‘And every shepherd tells his tale.’ And we still say, to keep tally for to keep count—Dyce (ed. i.): Was such an expression as ‘thick as tale’ ever employed by any writer whatsoever? I more than doubt it. Now, ‘thick as hail’ is of the commonest occurrence:—‘Out of the towne came quarriers thick as haile.—Drayton’s Battaile of Agincourt, p, 20, ed. 1627. [But a shower of arrows and a rapid succession of messengers are very distinct things. Singer, ed. ii.] ‘The English archers shoot as thick as haile.’—Harington’s Orlando Furioso, b. xvi, st. 51. ‘Rayning down bullets from a stormy cloud, As thick as hail, upon their armies proud.’— Sylvester’s Du Bartas,—Fourth Day of the First Week, p. 38, ed. 1641. ‘More thick they fall then haile.’—A Herrings Tayle, 1598. ‘Darts thick as haile their backs behinde did smite.’— Niccols’s King Arthur,—A Winter Night’s Vision, 1610, p. 583.—Collier (ed. ii.): The MS Corrector presents us with no emendation of ‘tale’; nevertheless, tale may be the right word, though the simile is very trite.—R. G. White: To say that men arrived as thick as tale, i.e. as fast as they could be told, is an admissible hyperbole; to say that men arrived as thick as hail, i.e. as close together as hailstones in a storm, is equally absurd and extravagant. The expression ‘as thick as hail’ is never applied, either in common talk or in literature, I believe, except to inanimate objects which fall or fly, or have fallen or flown, with unsucces-sive multitudinous rapidity.—Staunton: Rowe’s change was unwarrantable, and has been adopted by many editors for no other reason, it would appear, than that the former simile was unusual and the latter commonplace.—Halliwell: ‘Tale’ is an obvious blunder. The expression thick as hail is found in nearly every writer of the time.—Dyce (ed. ii.): ‘Galaxa... hail... words poured forth hastily and vehemently are termed galaxa.’—Maltby’s Greek Gradus, 1830. ‘Galaxate, hurl­ing abuse as thick as hail—Liddell and Scott’s Greek Lex. Clarendon: No parallel instance can be given for ‘as thick as tale.’"

Also, Angus claims (I, iii, 110) a share in Ross’s responsibility here. On the other hand, Duncan does not recognize the presence of Angus in I, ii, and refers to the approach of Ross and his companions—if he has any—by ‘comes.’ Also Ross says, in the same scene, ‘ I’ll,’ and later (I, iii, 115), ‘me.’ Some critics explain the inconsistency by supposing that Ross, in spite of his promise to the King (¢ I’ll see it done’), executed his commission by deputies. It is easier to assume that the editors of the Folio blundered at 1. 53, in the second scene, than that Shakespeare meant to perplex his audience, in this of all plays, with the unaccountable disobedience or indifference of a royal servant.—ED. ii."

The participial form is often employed for an adjective form, as in ‘the gzz/ed shore To a most dangerous sea’ (Mer. of Ven. III, ii, 97), where guzled = guileful.

A. BUCKLEY.—ED. ii.] 14, 17. There’s no Art... Face] DARMESTETER: For the sentiment herein expressed, compare Racine, Phedre, II, 4 (following Euripides, Medea, 516-520), ‘ Faut-il que sur le front d’ un profane adultére Brille de la vertu le sacré caractére ? Et pourquoi ne peut-on, a des signes certains, Reconnaitre le coeur des perfides humains.’ The arrival of Macbeth at these words, which he hears on entering, and the truth of which he is shortly to verify by his acts, forms a dramatic contrast to the elation of Duncan. This seems condemnatory of Garrick’s conception (that Macbeth’s face was always ‘ as a book where men might read strange matters’); Macbeth had had ample time to recompose his face. Talma here gave him the smile of his Nero in the interview with Agrippina.—ED. ii.—Lispy: This speech is Duncan’s death-warrant. It is not too much to say that in this play Shakespeare is most careful to preserve an exalted conception of retributive justice. Even Lady Macduff is most untrue to her noble husband before the murderers enter; Banquo forfeits his life (not to Macbeth, but to poetic justice) by his failure to warn Duncan and to defend Cawdor. Duncan forfeits his life by weakly condemning, on the parenthetical accusation of the thane of Ross, a nobleman who had been trusted with the ‘bosom interest’ of the king, ‘a gentleman on whom I built an absolute trust;’ one clearly, who had rivalled Macbeth and Banquo in his counsels. Though the lines, ‘The sin of my ingratitude,’ apply to Macbeth, yet they seem an echo of his feelings for the murdered Cawdor.—ED. ii."

The oath of allegiance, or liege homage, to the king, was absolute, and without any exception; but simple homage, when done to a subject for lands holden of him, was always with a saving of the allegiance (the love and honour) due to the sovereign. ‘Sauf la foy que jeo doy a nostre seignor le roy,’ as it is in Littleton.—As You LIKE It (Gent. Mag. lix, 713): Enclose ‘ children... everything’ in parenthesis, and read, ‘Safe to ward,’ etc.—SEYMOUR: ‘Safe to-ward.’ That is, with sure tendency, with certain direction.

This, however, seems the first distinct notion as to the plan of realizing his wishes; and here, therefore, with great propriety, Macbeth’s cowardice of his own conscience discloses itself.—ELWIN: Macbeth is speaking with reference to his late defence of Duncan from the enmity that would have robbed him of the affection and reverence of his subjects; and the meaning is, who do but what they should, by doing everything that can be done, which secures to you the love and honour that is your due.— CLARENDON: ‘Safe’ is used provincially for sure, certain."

        "The hearing of my Wife] FLETCHER (p. 183): It is not that Macbeth wavers either in his desire of the object or in his liking for the means; but that, the more imminent he feels the execution to be, the more he shrinks from the worldly responsibility that may follow, and the more he is driven to lean for support on the moral resolution of his wife. At his parting with the king, after saying: ‘I’ll be myself the harbinger,’ etc., immediately follows his eager exclamation which the inveterate misapprehension on the subject compels us to repeat again and again:—‘yet let that be Which the eye fears, when it is done to see.’ After this it seems truly strange that any critic should suppose for a moment that Macbeth’s very next words, ‘ My dearest love, Duncan comes here to-night,’ may imply a relenting from his purpose—how much soever they may indicate a fluttering in its execution. His selfish pusillanimity is simply seeking to cast upon her the burden of the final decision as to the act of murder. When to her own suggestive query, ‘And when goes hence?’ he answers, ‘To- morrow—as he purposes,’ is it not most clear that, still avoiding an explicit declaration of his immediate wish, he persists in urging the first utterance of it from her own lips?—Ed. ii. 62, 61. HERAUD (p. 343): Shakespeare only hints at Macbeth’s political motives; and his reason was that these in some degree justified the Thane’s aspirations; but Shakespeare was unwilling to permit them to appear to justify murder as the means of their accomplishment. He would not lend his countenance to the unreformed doctrine, still held by the Romanist, that ‘the end justifies the means.’ He does, however, provide Macbeth with an external determining cause, in the elevation of Malcolm to the princedom of Cumberland, which made him direct heir to the throne. We may imagine, if we please, that there had been some implied contract between Duncan and himself, that Macbeth should be his successor, and that this condition was violated by Duncan’s present act. We see that the king, to conciliate Macbeth, heaps up honours to him, and, it may be, regarded these as an equivalent substitute for the privilege of which at the same time he deprived him; and further makes amends by speaking of him in hypocritical terms of esteem, which are conceived in that exaggerated strain of compliment adopted by people when they are not sincere. Duncan pays deeply for this weakness, though otherwise a respectable person enough.—ED., ii."

Up to this moment there was, constitutionally—in the present and in the immediate future—but one life between him and the golden circlet. Now there are two and possibly three, for what was done in case of Malcolm may yet be done in case of Donalbain, and so Macbeth, who is all resolute when his mind is made up for action, has already decided that the overleaping of the barrier must be done this very night. When the murder is accomplished, Macbeth is spared the further exercise of his craft, [owing to the escape of the two princes], and he has only to point to their flight as an evidence of their guilt, and at once steps into his place as King of Scotland.—Ep. ii."

June, 1843, p. 710): Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter] Mrs Siddons’ entrance was hurried, as if she had but just glanced over the letter, and had been eager to escape from the crowd of attendants to reperuse it alone. She then read on, in a strong calm voice, until she came to the passage which proved the supernatural character of the prediction. . . . As she was about to pronounce the word ‘vanish’d,’ she paused, drew a short breath, her whole frame was disturbed, she threw her fine eyes upwards, and exclaimed ‘Vanished!’ with a wild force, which showed that the whole spirit of the temptation had shrunk into her soul. The ‘Hail, King that shalt be!’ was the winding up of the spell. It was pronounced with the grandeur of one already by anticipation a Queen.—Ed. ii.—Clarendon: She reads the letter, not now for the first time.—[Anonymous (Sunday Times, London, 30 Dec. 1888): On her first entrance as Lady Macbeth Miss Ellen Terry appears in a gown of peacock green and beetles wings, with a mantle of a kind of dull claret colour, a most picturesque figure, with rich red hair falling over her shoulders in two very long locks. Her reading of Macbeth’s letter is consequently very intent and full of terrible significance, for we see the wife’s mind absorbing itself in that of her beloved husband, and interpreting the suggestion of his written words. Miss Terry at once shows us that Lady Macbeth is, according to her reading, a very woman whose love for her husband subordinates to it every other consideration, so that the achieving of this ambition must be her first thought. She knows his nature, and as she takes up his miniature tenderly and talks to it in loving tones she reviews his kindliness of heart, and indicates that she must assume masculine strength to support him in the fatal purpose that he has revealed to her, and which she knows involves the ambition of his life. When Macbeth comes she rushes lovingly to his arms, and, with her woman’s instinct, at once commences to read his thoughts, and attempts to turn them to action.—Manly: The Clarendon Editors think she had read the letter before; perhaps so. But perhaps it is just as well to suppose she is now reading it for the first time, but has already read several sentences when she comes upon the stage. It is to be remembered, however, that stage letters are not constructed on the principles followed in life. They contain merely what furnishes to the audience a plausible excuse for the possession by the recipient of certain information; they are, as it were, mere symbols of the transmission of information. Hence it is that in a play we often find a person in possession of facts not contained in a letter, although that letter was the only source of information.—ED. ii.]",
        "Knowles (p. 17): Macbeths Wife] The Lady Macbeth of Mrs Siddons was the Genius of guilty ambition personified;—express in form, in feature, motion, speech. An awe invested her. You felt as if there was a consciousness in the very atmosphere that surrounded her, which communicated its thrill to you. There was something absolutely subduing in her presence—an overpowering something that commanded silence; or if you spoke, prevented you from speaking above your breath. It was a thing once witnessed never to be forgotten, more to be remembered than the most gorgeous pageant that ever signalized the triumph of human pride, or fulfilled the imaginings of human admiration.—ED. ii.—Chambers (p. 101): Lady Macbeth is strong just where her husband is weak, in self-conquest, singleness of will, and tenacity of purpose. Superstition and the strain of expectation will make him swerve from his course, but they have no power over her. She is the nobler character of the two; her ambition is for him, not for herself; it is for him that she divests herself of conscience, and, so far as may be, even of womanhood.—ED. ii.",

Leighton (Robinson’s Epit. of Lit. 15 April, 1879): ‘The perfectest report,’ which convinces the ambitious thane of the supernatural wisdom of the sisters, is very evidently, I think, to general readers, the report made by Ross of the king’s intention to invest him with the dignity of Thane of Cawdor, which agrees, in the ‘perfectest’ manner with the prediction of the sisters. The inquiring out of the witches at Forres, would be a piece of prosaic investigation very natural if the incident occurred in this sceptical age; but I do not find that it is in any way intimated in the play.—Chambers (p. 102): The profound impression made upon Macbeth’s guilty mind by the witches is shown by the immediate enquiry which he made as to their supernatural powers of knowledge. This can only have taken place during the brief interval between Scenes iii. and iv.; and it must have been at the same period that he sent the letter to his wife.—ED. ii.]"

        "Moulton (p. 149): Milke of humane kindnesse] I believe that this phrase, ‘the milk of human kindness,’ divorced from its context and become the most familiar of all commonplaces, has done more than anything else towards giving a false twist to the general conception of Macbeth’s character. The words And, kindness, are amongst the most difficult words in Shakespeare. The wide original signification of the root, natural, nature, still retained in the noun kind, has been lost in the adjective, which has been narrowed by modern usage to one sort of naturalness, tender-heartedness; though in a derivative form the original sense is still familiar to modern ears in the expression, ‘the kindly fruits of the earth.’ In Elizabethan English, however, the root signification still remained in all usages of kind and its derivatives. In Schmidt’s analysis of the adjective, two of its four significations agree with the modern use, the other two are ‘keeping to nature, natural,’ and ‘not degenerate and corrupt, but such as a thing or person ought to be.’ Shakespeare delights to play upon the two senses of this family of words: tears of joy are described as a ‘kind overflow of kindness’ (Much Ado, I, i, 26); the Fool says of Regan that she will use Lear ‘kindly,’ i.e., according to her nature (Lear I, v, 15); ‘the worm will do his kind,’ i.e. bite (Ant. & Cleo. V, ii, 264). How far the word can wander from its modern sense is seen in a phrase of the present play, ‘At your kind’st leisure’ (II, i; 35), where it is simply equivalent to ‘convenient.’ Still more will the wider signification of. the word obtain, when it is associated with the word human; ‘humankind’ is still an expression for human nature, and the sense of the passage we are considering would be more obvious if the whole phrase were printed as one word, not ‘human kindness,’ but ‘humankind-ness’:—that shrinking from what is not natural, which is a marked feature of the practical nature. The other part of the clause, milk of humankind-ness, no doubt suggests absence of hardness: but it equally connotes natural, inherited, traditional feelings, imbibed at the mother’s breast. The whole expression of Lady Macbeth, then, I take to attribute to her husband an instinctive tendency to shrink from whatever is in any way unnatural. That this is the true sense further appears, not only from the facts—for nothing in the play suggests that Macbeth, ‘Bellona’s bridegroom,’ was distinguished for kindness in the modern sense—but from the context. The form of Lady Macbeth’s speech makes the phrase under discussion a summing up of the rest of her analysis, or rather a general text which she proceeds to expand into details. Not one of these details has any connection with tender-heartedness: on the other hand, if put together, the details do amount to the sense for which I am contending, that Macbeth’s character is a type of commonplace morality, the shallow unthinking man’s lifelong hesitation between God and Mammon.—ED. ii.—Chambers comments upon the foregoing interpretation of Moulton, but suggests that abnormal, unconditional, is perhaps the more fitting word to describe Lady Macbeth’s estimate of ‘her husband’s character, rather than un-natural, as given by Moulton. Chambers also calls attention to the fact that ‘there are several closely parallel passages, in which milk connotes “absence of hardness.”’ He quotes the two passages cited by Delius [see note, line 17] and that cited by Clarendon.—ED. ii.",
        "Bodenstedt: humane kindnesse] We are somewhat astonished to learn this about Macbeth, for throughout the drama we find no trace of this ‘milk of human kindness.’ We must presume that the Lady has too high an opinion of her husband—an opinion, however, which will be soon enough lowered. We already know him as a quickly-determined ‘murderer in thought,’ and as an accomplished hypocrite; and this nature of his is not belied by the present letter: it appears only thinly disguised. The Lady knows at once what he is after: she knows and openly acknowledges that his ‘milk of human kindness’ will not deter him from attempting the life of old King Duncan, but only from ‘catching the nearest way’; that is, from laying his own hand to it.—Clarendon: Compare Lear, I, iv, 364."

This distinction may be discerned in good and evil as. contrasted with good and ill.—ED. ii.] 20-22: Allen (MS): What thou... winne] ‘Highly’ is an adverb substituted for an adjective (What thou wouldst, that is high, that thou wouldst [attain] in a holy manner.

        "Abbott (§ 329): would’st] ‘Would,’ like should, could, ought (Latin, potui, debui), is frequently used conditionally. Hence, ‘I would be great’ comes to mean, not ‘I wished to be great,’ but ‘I wished (subjunctive),’ i.e. ‘I should wish.’ There is, however, very little difference between ‘thou wouldest wish’ and ‘thou wishest,’ as is seen in the present passage. It is a natural and common mistake to say ‘would is used for should by Elizabethan writers.’ [See also I, vii, 40.] 21-26: Johnson: would’st not ...vndone] As the object of Macbeth’s desire is here introduced speaking of itself, it is necessary to read: ‘Thus thou must do if thou have me.’ 21-26: Malone: would’st not ...vndone] The construction is: thou would’st have that [i.e. the crown] which cries unto thee, ‘thou must do thus, if thou would’st have it, and thou must do that which rather,’ etc. The difficulty of this line and the succeeding hemistich seems to have arisen from their not being considered as part of the speech uttered by the object of Macbeth’s ambition.—Clarendon: But this interpretation [Malone’s] seems to require ‘would’st have it’ for ‘have it,’ or, at least, as Johnson proposed, ‘have me.’—Seymour: The difficulty here arises from the accumulative conjunction, which leads us to expect new matter, whereas that which follows [line 26] is only amplification. ‘Thou would’st have the crown; which cries, ‘thou must kill Duncan, if thou have it.’ This is an act which thou must do, if thou have the crown. ‘And’ (adds the Lady) ‘what thou art not disinclined to do, but art rather fearful to perform, than unwilling to have executed.’—Hunter: ‘Thus thou must do’ seems to me all that answers to ‘that which cries’; that is, Duncan must be taken off. The line halts, and I have no doubt that Shakespeare wrote, ‘if thou would’st have it.’ There should be a pause at ‘that’ in line 22, the mind supplying ‘is a thing.’ ‘What he must do,’ the murder, to secure the fulfilment of the witches’ prediction, is a something, which, according to his character as previously drawn by her, he would rather have done than do it. Perhaps there is a little want of art in making both the Thane and his lady fall at once into the intention of perpetrating a deed so atrocious.—Elwin: This passage [‘And... undone’] by being printed as part of the figured exclamation has been perverted from all sense. The object of Macbeth’s ambition is not a voluntary agent or rational existence, and, ‘Thus thou must do, if thou have it,’ is expressed simply by its nature, which cannot be supposed also to comment upon the disposition of Macbeth. The reflections on his sensations in connection with it, are made by Lady Macbeth as in her own person; and mean, ‘And it is that which,’ etc.—Delius: Might not Shakespeare have intended, by the words ‘that which cries,’ something other than the crown, the cold-blooded instinct to murder, which Macbeth might have possessed?— Clarendon: But if it [be as Delius suggests], ‘should’st have’ must be used in the sense of ‘thou should’st have.’ This is quite in accordance with Shakespeare’s usage, but is not probable in this case, where ‘would’st’ has just preceded, four times over, in the other sense. If we put the words ‘Thus... have it’ in inverted commas, we may interpret: Thou would’st have Duncan’s murder, which cries, ‘Thus thou must do if thou would’st have the crown,’ and which thou rather, etc. Coleridge: Macbeth is described by Lady Macbeth so as at the same time to reveal her own character. Could he have everything he wanted, he would rather have it innocently;—ignorant, as, alas! how many of us are, that he who wishes a temporal end for itself does in truth will the means; and hence the danger of indulging fancies.—[Hudson (ed. iii, p. 187): The original [line 25] has ‘and that which.’ This defeats the right sense of the passage, as it naturally makes ‘which’ refer to the same thing as ‘which’ in the preceding line; whereas it should clearly be taken as referring to the words ‘Thus thou must do.’ I prefer ‘A act which,’ and have little doubt that the original crept in by mistake from the line before.—R. F. Cholmley (N. & Qu. 9 June, 1894): No editor that I can find gives what appears to me the right interpretation of these lines. Lady Macbeth is harping upon the inconsistency of her husband’s character, and ends, as she began, by saying: ‘You want to satisfy your conscience and your ambition at the same time.’ The first ‘That’ is virtue, with its categorical ‘imperative’; the second is, of course, Duncan’s removal. ‘And,’ then, will exactly correspond to ‘And yet’ above: ‘would’st not play false, And yet would’st wrongly win’; and the words: ‘if thou have it,’ fall into their proper places as protasis to ‘cries.’ But the key to the passage is ‘And.’—Deighton (p. 97): Interpretations of this passage will vary according as the inverted commas extend to ‘do,’ to ‘it,’ or to ‘undone.’... If the inverted commas extend to ‘it,’ the meaning will probably be, you desire that (sc. the crown) which bids you to act in a certain way (sc. to murder Duncan) if you wish to secure it. In this case the succeeding words, ‘And that... undone,’ are Lady Macbeth’s comment and mean, And that (sc. the murder) is a thing which you rather hesitate to do than wish should not be done. If the inverted commas extend to ‘undone,’ the meaning will be, you desire that (sc. the crown) which cries, ‘Thus thou must do (sc. murder Duncan) if thou wouldst have it and thou must do that which rather,’ etc. The former interpretation seems much the better one; for the comment which would be natural in Lady Macbeth’s mouth, and is but an amplification of the words ‘would’st not play false And yet would’st wrongly win,’ looks odd if put into the mouth of the personified crown. The only thing gained by limiting the inverted commas to the words ‘Thus thou must do,’ is that we get rid of the difficulty in ‘it,’ where we should expect me; but the irregularity is hardly greater than in Jul. Ces. III, i, 30, ‘Casca, you are the first that rears your hand,’ where we should now write ‘rears his’ or ‘rear yours.’—ED. ii.] 25, 26: Moulton (p. 150): And... vndone] It is striking that at the very moment Lady Macbeth is so meditating, her husband is giving a practical confirmation of her description in its details as well as its general purport. He had resolved to take no steps himself towards the fulfilment of the Witches’ prophecy, but to leave all to chance; then the proclamation of Malcolm, removing all apparent chance of succession, led him to change his mind and entertain the scheme of treason and murder: the words with which he surrenders himself seems like an echo of his wife’s analysis, ‘yet let that be Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see’ (I, iv, 64, 65).—ED. ii."

That even the bird, whose harsh voice is accustomed to predict calamities, could not croak the entrance of Duncan but in a note of unwonted harshness. 43-45: Fuseli: The Rauen himfelfe is hoarfe] ’Tis certain, now—the raven himself is spent, is hoarse by croaking this very message, the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements. 43-45: Collier (ed. i.): The Rauen himfelfe is hoarfe] Lady Macbeth considers the fate of Duncan so certain that the ominous raven is hoarse with proclaiming it. Warburton’s emendation appears to be the direct opposite of what was intended by Shakespeare. Drayton, in his Baron’s Wars, 1603, Bk. V, st. 42, has these lines: ‘The ominous raven with a dismal cheer, Through his hoarse beak of following horror tells. 43-45: Hunter (ii, 174): The Rauen himfelfe is hoarfe] There are probably few readers who do not understand this phrase in its plain and I should say obvious sense, that even the raven which croaks the fatal entrance has more than its usual hoarseness. Nothing is more common than to speak of the raven croaking ominously. 43-45: Manly (p. 102): The Rauen himfelfe is hoarfe] Some of the editors strangely suppose that by ‘the raven’ is meant the messenger who is almost dead for breath. To say nothing of the remarkable assumption that scantness of breath causes hoarseness, this shows lack of acquaintance with the superstition of the time. Scot, Discoverie of Witchcraft: ‘[It is most impious] to prognosticate that ghests approch to your house, upon the chattering of pies or haggisters,’ [p. 170, ed. 1584]. The approach of an ordinary guest might be announced by a magpie, but for such a visit as Duncan’s the hoarse croaking of a raven would alone be appropriate. This is practically the opinion of Nicholson, the editor of Scot, who adds from W. Perkins, Witchcraft, 1613: ‘When a raven stands on a high place and looks a particular way and cries, a corse comes thence soon.’ 43-45: Bell (p. 302): The Rauen himfelfe is hoarfe] [Mrs Siddons uttered this] after a long pause when the messenger has retired.

But naturally, where the difference is so slight, much variety may be expected. Ben Jonson adds that ‘all verbs coming from the Latin, either of the supine or otherwise, hold the accent as it is found in the first person present of those Latin verbs; as from célebro, célebrate.’ The same fluctuation between the English and French accent is found in Chaucer (Prof. Child, in Ellis, Early English Pronunciation, i, 369).—Clarendon: ‘Access’ is always accented by Shakespeare on the second syllable, except in Hamlet, II, i,",
        "Clarendon: compunctious] Only used in this passage in Shakespeare, and compunction not at all. ‘Compunct’ is used in Wickliff’s Bible, Acts, ii, 37, and ‘compuncture’ by Jeremy Taylor. 51, 52: Johnson: peace... hit] The intent of Lady Macbeth evidently is to wish that no womanish tenderness or conscientious remorse may hinder her purpose from proceeding to effect; but neither this, nor any other sense, is expressed by the present reading; perhaps Shakespeare wrote ‘keep face between,’ etc., which may signify to pass between, to intervene. 51, 52: Malone: peace... hit] A similar expression is found in The Tragicall Hystorie of Romeus and Juliet, 1562: ‘the lady no way could Kepe trewse betwene her greefes and her.’ D’Avenant’s version sometimes affords a reasonably good comment. [See Appendix,]— Knight: If fear, compassion, or any other compunctious visitings, stand between a cruel purpose and its realization, they may be said to keep peace between them, as one who interferes between a violent man and the object of his wrath keeps peace.—Hudson (ed. ii.): One might naturally think this should read, ‘nor break peace between the effect and it’; that is, nor make the effect contradict, or fall at strife with, the purpose. The sense, however, doubtless is, nor make any delay, any rest, any pause for thought, between the purpose and the act.—[Hudson (ed. iii, p. 188): The attempts that have been made to explain ‘nor keep peace’ are, it seems to me, either absurdly ingenious and over-subtle or something worse. The natural sense of it is clearly just the reverse of what was intended. To be sure, almost any language can be tormented into yielding almost any meaning. And we have too many instances of what may be called a fanaticism of ingenuity, which always delights especially in a reading that none but itself can explain, and in an explanation that none but itself can understand. The other error, ‘hit,’ corrects itself—ED. ii.]—Bailey (ii, 24): Let us read, ‘nor keep space between,’ etc. She supplicates that no compunctious feelings may keep space between (i.e. interpose between) her purpose and its execution."

        "Steevens: dunnest] The Rambler (No. 168) criticises the epithet ‘dun’ as mean. Milton, however, appears to have been of a different opinion, and has represented Satan as flying (Par. Lost, iii, 7) ‘——in the dun air sublime.’ So also in Comus, ‘sin Which these dun shades will ne’er report,’ [l. 126].—Clarendon: To our ears ‘dun’ no longer sounds mean. As Horace says, Ars Poet. 70, 71, ‘Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus.’—[The passage in The Rambler to which Steevens refers is as follows: ‘What can be more dreadful than to implore the presence of night, invested not in common obscurity, but in the smoke of hell? Yet the efficacy of this innovation is destroyed by the insertion of an epithet, now seldom heard but in the stable, and “dun night” may come or go without any other notice than contempt.’ Johnson, forgetting that it was Lady Macbeth who is here the speaker, said that these lines are uttered by Macbeth when ‘confirming himself in the horrid purpose of stabbing his king.’ In his Dictionary, three years later, Dr Johnson no longer considers ‘dun’ as a word of the stable, but thus defines it: ‘(1) A colour partaking of brown and black. (2) Dark; gloomy’; nor, in his edition of this play, which appeared ten years later, is any slur cast on its respectability.—ED. ii.] 56-58: Steevens: And... darke] Drayton, Polyolbion, 26th Song, has an expression like this: ‘Thick vapours, that, like rugs, still hang the troubled air.’—Malone: Polyolbion was not published till 1612, after this play had certainly been exhibited; but in an earlier piece Drayton has the same expression, ‘The sullen night in mistie rugge is wrapp’d,’ Mortimeriados, 1596. ‘Blanket’ was perhaps suggested by the coarse woollen curtain of Shakespeare’s own theatre, through which, probably, while the house was yet but half- lighted, he had himself often peeped.—Halliwell: That the players did sometimes ‘peep’ through such a curtain appears from the Prologue to The Unfortunate Lovers, 1643, [D’Avenant].—Whiter (p 155 et seq.): Nothing is more certain than that all the images in this passage are borrowed from the stage. The peculiar and appropriate dress of Tragedy is a pall and a knife. When Tragedies were represented, the stage was hung with black, which Malone, in his Theatrical Memoirs (p. 89), says was ‘no more than one piece of black baize placed at the back of the stage, in the room of the tapestry, which was the common decoration when Comedies were acted.’ I am persuaded, however, that, on the same occasions, the Heavens, or the Roof of the Stage, underwent likewise some gloomy transformation. This might be done by covering with black those decorations about the roof which were designed to imitate the appearance of the Heavens, conveying to the audience the idea of a dark and gloomy night, in which every luminary was hidden from the view. In the Rape of Lucrece (764-770) there is a wonderful coincidence with this passage, in which we have not only ‘Black stage for Tragedies and murders fell,’ but also ‘comfort-killing NIGHT, image of HELL,’ corresponding with ‘thick NIGHT, and the dunnest smoke of HELL. Again, in line 788, we have ‘Through Night’s black bosom should not peep again.’ [The author quotes many parallel passages from Shakespeare and contemporary authors.— ED.]—Collier (Notes, p. 408, ed, i.): In fact, it is not at all known whether the curtain, separating the audience from the actors, was woollen or linen. As it seems to us, the substitution the MS Corrector recommends cannot be doubted—‘the blankness of the dark.’ The scribe misheard the termination of blankness, and absurdly wrote ‘blanket.’—C. A. Brown (p. 178) [After ridiculing Dr Johnson’s condemnation in this passage of such words as ‘dun,’ and ‘knife,’ and ‘peep,’ and supposing that it would be mightier in Johnsonian phrase: ‘direct a glance of perquisition through the fleecy-woven integument of the tenebrosity,’ the author adds]: Lady Macbeth determines on murdering the King in his bed. ‘Topfull of direst [sic] cruelty’ in the anticipation of the deed, her thoughts occupied in the very act of stabbing her guest in his bed, she naturally, and consequently with propriety, takes a metaphor from it in the word blanket. By the occasional skilful application of a common every-day expression, the application of a household word, the mingling of the conveniences or wants of life with deeds of death, our imagination, while reading Shakespeare, is so forcibly enthralled. Had the old King been described as reposing on a stately couch, after the fatigue of his journey, we could not have sympathised with his fate so much as when we find him, like ourselves, sleeping in a bed, with sheets and blankets. Such is at least a portion of Shakespeare’s magic. To find fault with it is to wish to be disenchanted.—Dyce: Coleridge proposed ‘the blank height of the dark,’ etc.; a conjecture which appeared in the first edition of his Table Talk (ii, 296), but which, on my urging its absurdity to the editor, was omitted in the second edition of that valuable miscellany. The old reading is thoroughly confirmed by the quotations in the Varéorum.—R.G. White: The man who does not apprehend the meaning and the pertinence of the figure, ‘the blanket of the dark,’ had better shut his Shakespeare, and give his days and nights to the perusal of— some more correct and classic writer.—Knight (ed. ii.): The phrase in Cymb. III, i, 43, ‘If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,’ gives the key to the metaphor.—Collier (ed. ii.): This passage from Cymb. has no other relation to the line in Macbeth than that ‘blanket’ occurs in both plays.—Bailey (i, 92): Blackness is in every way preferable to blankness; and we must bear in mind that ‘the dark’ is here a synonyme for The night. This reading is supported by Ant. and Cleop. I, iv, 13. And it may also derive indirect support from a remarkable expression in the epistle of St. Jude, verse xiii.: ‘Wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.’—Staunton: If ‘blanket’ is a word too coarse for the delicacy of the commentators, what say they to the following from Middleton’s Blurt, Master-Constable, III, i.?—‘Blest night, wrap Cynthia in a sable sheet.’ Clarendon: The covering of the sleeping world. From the French blanket. For homeliness of expression we may compare another passage from Mortimeriados, sig. C 2 recto: ‘As when we see the spring-begetting Sunne, In heauens black night-gowne couered from our sight.’ Halliwell: There is no reason for suspecting any corruption.—Jessopp (N. & Qu. 3d S. VII, 21 Jan. 1865): For ‘blanket’ substitute blankest, which conveys the idea of the most intense darkness, and, being a word such as Shakespeare would use, adds to the power of the passage. [In N. & Qu. 1 Apr. 1865, ‘B. T.’ proposed ‘danket,’ with the meaning given to it in old dictionaries of ‘thundercloud.’ But on 10 June, 1865, he admitted his error, ‘as, after much search, no confirmation of that sense’ could be found.—ED.]—[W. Leighton (Robinson’s Epit. of Lit. 1 Feb. 1879): The word ‘blanket’ seems to be used with reference to the idea that a person may be so enveloped in a blanket as to be unrecognizable. The figure may spring from this thought of concealment by being covered with darkness, blanketed from sight, together with the quickening imaginings of her restless fancy, which have already suggested that the best place and time for the perpetration of the deed will be the king’s bed, after he has retired for the night—the king’s bed, hence, blanket. There appears a double intent or suggestion in these lines; one meaning following the thought of security, that even heaven will not know the evildoer so blanketed; and the other, that the obscuring shadow of images, of crime—‘the dunnest smoke of hell’—shall so crowd her mind and inspire her acts that no glimpse of heaven—conscience—may shine through to call upon the criminal to hold her hand. Both of these meanings are so naturally suggested by the train of thought and images that fill her brain that they mingle and find expression in the same words, although they are, in their natures, separate and distinct. Her resolution thus supported by spirits of ill—grim imaginings—she pushes her husband, willing and unwilling, into the crime which brings a terrible retribution to both.—ED. ii.]"

      "play": "DUNCAN: This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air",
      "notes": [
        "ForsyTH (p. 64): This Castle ...seat] Action, life, passion—men and women in every conceivable position—are nearly all in all throughout Shakespeare’s works; external nature being used only as a foil to show off the lights and shades of the great drama of human existence. ... Shakespeare does not paint landscapes at all, as we now understand that word, not even for his own special dramatic purposes. In observation his faculty is microscopical; a wide and extended view of natural scenery he will not pourtray. With unerring accuracy of eye he seizes on particular objects, investing them with the lively hues of his exuberant imagination; he does not see, he does not choose to describe, an entire landscape. ... What is perhaps the most noticeable of all is, that in his sketches, incomplete as they are, of natural scenery, he scarcely ever mentions that form of it which is now held as the most enchanting, sublime, and attractive to cultivated minds—the scenery, namely, of mountainous regions. ... Whatever else the great poet saw in nature, he apparently could not see the grandeur of the everlasting hills; ‘the difficult air of the iced mountain top’ was by him unbreathed and unknown. Once only, in the whole range of his works (unless we should except some slight references in Cymbeline), does he introduce his readers to the heart of a wild and hilly region. ... The allusions to the site of Macbeth’s castle happen to be perfectly correct; the wonder is how the writer should have been conversant with such details. ... [Whether Shakespeare described the scene from personal observation or from an inspiration of genius], the puzzle is how the describer should have overlooked other features of infinitely more prominence and importance in the landscape surrounding Inverness—the magnificent sweep of river and estuary, and the grand domination of the different mountain ranges.",
        "JOHNSON (QOds. 1745): seat] I propose szze, as the ancient word for s¢¢uation. [Capell also made this conjecture.—ED. ii.] For the sake of the measure, I adjust line 11, ‘Smells wooingly. Here is no jutting frieze’ [As Dr Johnson did not repeat these emendations in his edition of 1765, we may presume that they were withdrawn.—EpD.]—REED: Compare Bacon’s £ssays, xlv.: ‘He that builds a faire house upon an ill seat, committeth himself to prison. Neither doe I reckon it an ill seat, only where the aire is unwholesome, but likewise where the aire is unequal; as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of ground invironed with higher hills round about it.—S1r J. REYNOLDs: This short dialogue between Duncan and Banquo has always appeared to me a striking instance of what in painting is termed repose. Their conversation very naturally turns upon the beauty of [the castle’s] situation, and the pleasantness of the air; and Banquo, observing the martlets’ nests in every recess of the cornice, remarks, that where those birds most breed and haunt, the air is delicate. The subject of this quiet and easy conversation gives that repose so necessary to the mind after the tumultuous bustle of the preceding scenes, and perfectly contrasts the scene of horror that immediately succeeds. It seems as if Shakespeare asked himself, What is a prince likely to say to his attendants on such an occasion? Whereas the modern writers seem, on the contrary, to be always searching for new thoughts, such as would never occur to men in the situation which is represented. This also is frequently the practice of Homer, who, from the midst of battles and horrors, relieves and refreshes the mind of the reader by introducing some quiet rural image, or picture of familiar domestic life. [See also, to the same effect, REED, Lectures, etc. p. 231.—KNOWLES (p. 24): I am inclined to take a different view of the subject [from that expressed by Reynolds in the preceding note], and to consider this scene as another and a higher step in the climax of the action. That Duncan should contemplate with satisfaction the seat of Macbeth’s castle, and that Banquo should participate in the feelings of the King, are perfectly natural; but that the audience should partake this view, is as preposterous as to suppose that we could see a man about to step into a cavern which we know to be the den of a wild beast, and participate in his admiration of the foliage which might happen to adorn its entrance. So far, if I mistake not, from there being any relaxing of the interest here, there is an absolute straining of it. The unconsciousness of the destined victim to the fate that awaited it, the smiling flowers that dressed it, and its playful motions as it walked to the altar of sacrifice must have served, not to assuage, but to aggravate in the beholder the feeling of its predicament. There is no relief—no repose here. How often in witnessing this scene have I felt a wish that some suspicion of foul play would flash across the mind of Banquo, and that he would hang upon the robes of the king and implore him not to enter.—ED. ii. ]"

Focco (SA. Soc. Trans. 1875-6): Where ...delicate] I cannot find that other observers have noticed a propensity in the swallow to seek localities where the air is especially pure and delicate. The observation, however, is borne out so far by MacGillivray, who remarks that though they are to be found chiefly in the neighbourhood of towns, villages, and farm buildings in the more populous parts of the country, yet small colonies of them will establish themselves on the margin of the moors and wild glens of the pastoral regions, in the valleys of the upper districts of the Clyde, the Tweed, the Dee, and the Tay, where they will build on the inns and larger houses.

Carew, the author, is describing Blarney Castle: ‘It is four piles joined in one, seated upon a main rock, so as to be free from mining, the walls eighteen feet thick, and flanked at each corner to the best advantage.’ Shakespeare’s French reading, perhaps, supplied him with it-—Dycr (Few Votes, etc.): Coigne is certainly a word of rare occurrence: ‘And Cape of Hope, last coign of Africa.’—Sylvester's Du Bartas, The Colonies, p. 129, ed. 1641.

If you pray for us on account of the trouble we create in your house, and thank us for the molestations we bring with us, it must be on such a principle. Herein I teach you, that the inconvenience you suffer, is the result of our affection; and that you are therefore to pray for us, or thank us, only as far as prayers and thanks can be deserved for kindnesses that fatigue, and honours that oppress. You are, in short, to make your acknowledgments for intended respect and love, however irksome our present mode of expressing them may have proved. To ‘bid’ is here used in the Saxon sense—to pray.—KNIGHT: The love which follows us is sometimes troublesome; so we give you trouble, but look you only at the love we bear to you, and so bless us and thank us.—CoLLigr: Duncan says that even love sometimes occasions him trouble, but that he thanks it as love notwithstanding; and that thus he teaches Lady Macbeth, while she takes trouble on his account, to ‘bid God yield,’ or reward, him for giving that trouble. —HUNTER: The affection which urges us to desire the society of our friends is sometimes the occasion of trouble to them; but still we feel grateful for the affection which is manifested. So you are to regard this visit; and with this view of it you will be disposed to thank us for the trouble which we occasion you."

He drank in, as greedily as his partner in arms, the prophecies of the weird tempters, but lacked Macbeth’s prompt resolution to act; he lacked also the favouring circumstances that led Macbeth to the murder of King Duncan; and, above all, he lacked the incitements to action, which came to the thane of Cawdor by the fiery suggestions of his wife. No plain way to the crown suggested itself to Banquo; in fact, he saw clearly that not only Duncan, but Macbeth, stood between him and regal honours. Before the king’s murder he evidently suspected Macbeth’s intention, and afterwards must have been fully assured of his guilt; yet he uttered no word of warning to his kinsman and sovereign, and after the murder, no hint of his suspicion. Would a noble and virtuous man have kept such doubtful silence?"

Banquo’s reply is only that of a man who determines to combat every possible temptation to do ill. Macbeth could never mean, while yet the success of his attack on the life of Duncan was uncertain, to afford Banquo the most dark or distant hint of his criminal designs on the crown. Had he acted thus incautiously, Banquo would naturally have become his accuser, as soon as the murder had been discovered.",

        "Delius: cleaue...you] If you will cleave to the agreement with me, it shall in due time make honour for you. ‘Consent’ is, perhaps through being confounded with concent, more than a mere passive agreement or understanding, just as to consent is used in this more expanded sense in Oth.

        "Seymour: Is this, etc.] This is always delivered on the stage with an expression of terror as well as surprise, but I am persuaded it is a misconception : if the vision were indeed terrible, the irresolute spirit of Macbeth would shrink from it; but the effect is confidence and animation, and he tries to lay hold of the dagger; and indeed upon what principle of reason, or on what theory of the mind, can it be presumed that the appearance of supernatural agency, to effect the immediate object of our wish, should produce dread and not encouragement?",
        "Knowles: Is this, etc.] I have long entertained the opinion that this dagger is an apparition coming and vanishing, as the witches themselves do, and that consequently it ought to be actually presented, as indeed it used to be. In my mind the whole thing is too circumstantial to justify the common interpretation which coincides with that of Macbeth. It is a phantom raised by the witches to draw Macbeth on to his conclusion. Upon the very threshold of guilt he is faltering. But the evil agency of which he is the victim is at hand with the dagger, inviting him to clutch it as he attempts to do; nor withdraws it then, but while he is yet in doubt ends the debate by exhibiting it to him stained with gouts of blood—‘ Which was not so before.’ Macbeth’s interpretation of the vision is not to be taken as the truth.",
        "Beckham: Is this, etc.] In Freitag’s pictures of German history I find underneath a portrait of a woman of the Royal palace (circa 1440) some remarks which correctly elucidate this present passage. The scene is the night on which the holy crown of Hungary was stolen, and the emotions of Helen Kottaner, a woman of decided feminine character, are portrayed. She is in deadly peril; we learn how anguish and the pangs of conscience affect her soul. But the inward struggle and conscientious scruples take material form and crowd upon her as a strange external horror. ‘That rousing of the senses to an activity,’ says Freitag, ‘which clothes with external semblance the vague horror in the soul is universal and pre-eminently characteristic of the extreme youth of every people. Human freedom is not yet sufficiently large to solve by thought and self-knowledge the inward struggles, but this emancipation begins by a conflict with a material apparition of what tortures the soul. The battle is fought outwardly. In such-wise, at one time, has all the world struggled. Thus Luther fought his mighty battle. And if the incomparable Poet, who with superior independence raised himself above the English temper of the sixteenth century, shows us his tragic hero contending with the ghosts of his victims and with the dagger, the instrument of his crime, such a representation, which we now consider eminently poetic, had a significance for his audience quite other than merely artistic. At that time they thus struggled with sin and doubt. And if Shakespeare’s phantoms seem to us too numerous, as in Richard III, all who then looked on in horror knew well that such forms ad appear to sinning man and caused his hair to stand on end.",

Even lust and envy sleep!’ [III, ii, 1-5]. These lines, though so well known, I have transcribed, that the contrast between them and this passage of Shakespeare may be more accurately observed. Night is described by two great poets, but one describes a night of quiet, the other of perturbation. In the night of Dryden, all the disturbers of the world are laid asleep; in that of Shakespeare, nothing but sorcery, lust, and murder is awake. He that reads Dryden, finds himself lulled with serenity, and disposed to solitude and contemplation. He that peruses Shakespeare, looks round alarmed, and starts to find himself alone.

        "Steevens: present horror] The latter is surely the true meaning. Macbeth would have nothing break through the universal silence that added such a horror to the night, as suited well with the bloody deed he was about to perform. Burke, in his Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, observes that ‘all general privations are great, because they are all terrible’; and with other things he gives silence as an instance, illustrating the whole by that remarkable passage in Virgil, where, amidst all the images of terror that could be united, the circumstance of silence is particularly dwelt upon: ‘Dii, quibus imperium est animarum, Umbræque silentes, et Chaos et Phlegethon, loca nocte tacentia late.’—Aeneid, vi, 264, 5. When Statius, in the fifth book of the Thebaid, describes the Lemnian massacre, his frequent notice of the silence and solitude, both before and after the deed, is striking in a wonderful degree: ‘Conticuere domus,’ etc.; and when the same poet enumerates the terrors to which Chiron had familiarized his pupil, he subjoins, ‘ nec ad vasta trepidare silentia sylvæ.’— Achilleid, ii, 391. Again, when Tacitus describes the distress of the Roman army under Czcina, he concludes by observing, ‘ ducemque terruit diva silentia.’—Annail. I, xv. In all the preceding passages, as Pliny remarks, concerning places of worship, silentia ipsa adoramus.",
        "Malone: present horror] So also in Aeneid, ii, [755]: ‘Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent.’ Dryden’s well-known lines, which exposed him to so much ridicule, ‘An horrid stillness first invades the ear, And in that silence we the tempest hear,’ show that he had the same idea of the awfulness of silence as our Poet. [Astrea Redux, vv. 7,8. In the edition of 1688 of Astrea Redux—the earliest I have been able to consult—the last line reads, ‘... we the tempest fear.’ Warton also, in his edition of Dryden’s poems, thus gives it; and in his introduction states the same fact as Malone: that Dryden was much ridiculed for these two lines, but makes no mention that they ever were as Malone has quoted them.— ED. ii.]"

        "Johnson: sides] A ‘ravishing’ s‘ride is an action of violence, impetuosity, and tumult, like that of a savage rushing on his prey; whereas the Poet is here attempting to exhibit an image of secrecy and caution, of anxious circumspection and guilty timidity, the ‘stealthy pace’ of a ravisher creeping into the chamber of a virgin, and of an assassin approaching the bed of him whom he proposes to murder, without awaking him; these he describes as ‘moving like ghosts,’ whose progression is so different from strides, that it has been in all ages represented to be as Milton expresses it: ‘Smooth sliding without step.’ This hemistich will afford the true reading of this place, which is, I think, to be corrected thus: ‘ With Tarquin ravishing, slides tow’rds,’ etc.",
        "Heath: sides] The objection to strides is founded wholly in a mistake. Whoever hath experienced walking in the dark must have observed that a man under this disadvantage always feels out his way by strides, by advancing one foot, as far as he finds it safe, before the other, and that if he were to slide or glide along, as ghosts are represented to do, the infallible consequence would be his tumbling on his nose.",
        "Steevens: sides] Spenser uses the word [stride] in his Faerie Queene, IV, c. viii, [v. 37], and with no idea of violence annexed to it: ‘With easy steps so soft as foot could stride.’ Again, Harington, 1591, Orlando Furioso, Bk, xxviii, st. 63, ‘He takes a long and leisurable stride.’ The ravisher and murderer would naturally stride in order that their steps might be fewer in number, and the sound of their feet be repeated as seldom as possible.",
        "Warburton: sides] Compare Lucrece, 162-168.",
        "Knight: sides] Strides, in its usual acceptation, and looking at its etymology, does not convey the notion of stealthy and silent movement. We receive it as Milton uses it: ‘The monster. .. came as fast With horrid strides,’ etc. [Paradise Lost, Bk, II,1.676.—ED. ii.]. Can we reconcile, then, the word ‘sides’ with the context? Might we not receive it as a verb, and read the passage, with his stealthy pace (Which Tarquin’s ravishing sides) towards his design, Moves,’ etc. To ‘side’ is to match, to balance, to be in a collateral position. Thus in Ben Jonson’s Sejanus: ‘Whom he... Hath rais’d from excrement to side the gods?’ [IV, v; p. 108, ed, Gifford]. In the passage before us, ‘murther’ ‘with his stealthy pace,’ which pace sides, matches, ‘Tarquin’s ravishing’ (ravishing a noun), ‘moves like a ghost towards his design. Watch and ‘With’ were often contracted in writing, and might easily be mistaken by the printer.—Hunter: Tarquin seems to have haunted the imagination of Shakespeare from his early days, when he chose the rape of Lucretia as the subject of a poem. He appears in the plays several times, and often unexpectedly, and certainly never less propitiously than here, whether we read strides or ‘sides.’ It would a little improve the passage if, for ‘With,’ we read Or, the two motions of the murderer, stealthy and hasty.",
        "Dyce: sides] I have no doubt that strides is the genuine reading. Those who object that the word conveys an idea of violence, etc., ought to remember that Shakespeare in a very early poem had described that very Tarquin as ‘stalking’ into the chamber of Lucretia.—The Rape of Lucrece, 366.",
        "Collier: sides] There can be no doubt about the fitness of Pope’s emendation, although it is not made by the MS Corrector.",
        "R. G. White: sides] Pope’s emendation will seem happy to every cautious person who has stepped through a sick chamber, or any apartment in which there were sleepers whom he did not wish to wake, and who remembers how he did it.",
        "Delius: sides] ‘Ravishing’ is not to be connected with ‘strides’ as a participle, but as a verbal substantive.",
        "Clarendon: sides] Stride is not used in the sense in which Johnson and Knight interpret it in Oth. (I; I, iii, 268.",
        "Moberly: sides] It seems possible that this may be a form of the Saxon stih, a step; and that therefore no emendation is necessary. So the old form ‘nave’ (Saxon, naff) is used above [I, ii, 28] for navel. The word sith is the same as German Schritt; compare the similar omission of n in sprechen, briisten, pfirsche (persica), a peach.",
        "Sprague: sides] A ‘sidesman’ in Milton is a partisan; the word now means, an assistant to a church-warden. ‘Tarquin’s ravishing sides’ may be Tarquin’s ravishing party, the gang of devilish agencies and auxiliaries... that throng round Tarquin. With these, for the moment, withered Murder joins and moves towards his bloody deed."

        "B. Nicholson: sowre] While ‘sure and firm-set’ is, as a general epithet of the earth, unexceptionable, it is here no poet’s epithet, but a mere poetaster’s, for it has no relevancy. Looking to the context and to circumstances under which Macbeth is speaking, I should as soon expect Shakespeare to make him use such an epithet as to hear Richard talk of ‘Blushing Aurore, morn of our discontent.’ What is the earth of which Macbeth speaks? The pebbled courtyard or the stone-paved corridors in which the scene takes place. Macbeth’s thoughts and fears are naturally attracted to the noises of the footsteps of Banquo, Fleance, and himself, as would those of any one who had on his mind a secret deed of darkness. I propose, therefore, by adding one letter to sowre, to read, ‘Thou stowre and firm-set earth.’ Halliwell (Phillipps) gives stow as still an eastern county’s provincialism for ‘stiff or inflexible,’ and quotes from Palsgrave; ‘Stoure rude as coarse cloth is, gros,’ and ‘stowre of conversation, estourdy.’ So also Ray, Glossary of South and East Country Words (Eng. D. Soc.): ‘Stowve, adj., inflexible, sturdy, and stiff, spoken also of cloth in opposition to limber’ Again, in writings just prior to or contemporaneous with Shakespeare’s, we have (Prompt. Parv.): ‘Stoor (store, MS, K. Coll. Cam.), hard or boystous. Austerus, rigidus.’ ‘Thys pange was greater ... then when the stower nayles were... driven through hys handes and fete,’ Latimer, Serm. 7 (Arber’s repr. p. 185). By this change Macbeth is made to refer to the hard, unyielding, and therefore resounding stones of the courtyard, and we thus get epithets in exact accord with his thoughts. It now remains to explain how the error arose. This scene so bristles with errors that one is forced to conclude that the compositor was either a new or a very careless hand. Hence in reading he confounded the t with the long line and loops of the preceding s. Nor is this mere supposition, for he did the same in the very line above, printing ‘Tarquin’s ravishing sides,’ where, pace Knight, the word must be either strides or slides. I may add that exactly the same mistake, as I think, occurs in Herbert’s Church Porch, st. xx, 1. 3: ‘Constancie knits the bones and makes us sowre (Wm.’s MS); stowre (pr. edds.)."

I have inserted this stage-direction that the reader may the better understand the construction of the old theatre.’ Again, when Macbeth calls out, ‘Who's there?’ he inserts, before the exclamation, ‘he appears above,’ and after it, ‘he again withdraws.’ Tieck says, ‘I have also added these directions for the sake of perspicuity. The editors make him say this without being seen—‘‘within’’—which is an impossibility. To whom should he make this inquiry within the chambers, where all are sleeping? The king, besides, does not sleep in the first, but in the second, chamber; how loud, then, must be the call to be heard from within the second chamber in the courtyard below! The original, at this passage, has Enter Macbeth. I explain this peculiar direction thus: Macbeth lingers yet a moment within; his unquiet mind imagines it hears a noise in the court below, and thoughtlessly, bewildered, and crazed, he rushes back to the balcony, and calls beneath, ‘‘Who’s there?’’ In his agony, however, he waits for no answer, but rushes back into the chambers to execute the murder. Had Fleance or Banquo, or even any of the servants of the house, whom he had but just sent away, been beneath, the whole secret deed would have been betrayed. I consider this return, which appears but a mere trifle, as a striking beauty in Shakespeare’s drama. He delights (because he always sets tragedy in activity through passion as well as through intrigue) in suspending success and failure on a needle’s point.’—FRIESEN: Shakespeare always takes the greatest pains to afford, unrestricted up to the last moment, a certain freedom of will to all his characters whose tragic paths lead to destruction. None of his tragic heroes are so enmeshed by fate or accident or intrigue that no loop-hole of safety is left them. This is so pre-eminently in Macbeth. The consummation of the awful crime is suspended up to the last moment, when Macbeth, terrified at some noise, once more emerges in doubt from Duncan’s chamber. It were needless here to seek for reasons on theoretic grounds; the fearful struggle between persevering defiance and yearning for repentance, which so powerfully affects us in the subsequent treatment, would be, without this antecedent, meaningless, or at least far from tragic.—[BOOTH: This line is spoken by one of the drunken Chamberlains.—ED, ii.]",

An unsuccessful attempt would produce to them infinite mischief,—an attempt without the deed.—Dyce: To me at least it is plain that here ‘the attempt’ is put in strong opposition to ‘the deed,’ and that ‘confounds’ has no reference to future mischief, but solely to the perplexity and consternation of the moment."

And the difference between imagination and feeling is, that the one acts most at a distance, the other on the spot. This gush of native tenderness, coming in thus after her terrible audacity of thought and speech, has often reminded us of a line in Schiller’s noble drama, The Piccolomini, IV, iv: ‘ Bold were my words, because my deeds were not.’ And we are apt to think that the hair-stiffening extravagance of her previous speeches arose in part from the sharp conflict between her feelings and her purpose; she endeavoring thereby to school and steel herself into a firmness and fierceness of which she feels the want.—[LADY CHARLEMONT (New Sh. Soc. Trans. 1876, p. 194): We find that in the eleventh century Macbeth married the Lady Gruach, granddaughter of King Kenneth IV, who had been deposed in the year 1003 by Malcolm, son of Kenneth III. This Malcolm was succeeded by his grandson, Duncan, who was murdered in the year 1039 by his cousin Macbeth, who then ascended the throne of Scotland. We may suppose that the quarrels about the succession to the throne took place between kinsmen more or less nearly related. May not there have been a relationship between Kenneth IV. and Duncan? And may not one of the strange likenesses which come and go in families, have appeared between Kenneth’s son and Duncan, causing Lady Macbeth to say of the latter, ‘Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I had don’t’? And had not hatred to the man whose grandsire had not only deposed hers—depriving her father of his throne—but had also burnt her first husband in his castle, with fifty of his friends, and slain her only brother and her second husband’s (Macbeth’s) father, anything to say to Duncan’s fate, though Shakespeare has weakened her primary motive by hinting at her secondary one?—F. J. FURNIVALL, in speaking of the above suggestion by Lady Charlemont, calls attention to the fact that ‘Shakespeare took his Macbeth story from Holinshed,... and that there is nothing in Holinshed about the murder of either Lady Macbeth’s or Macbeth’s relatives by Malcolm, Duncan’s grandfather.—ED. ii.]"

He was not satisfied with her first explanation. The sounds had been no screaming of the owl, no crying of the cricket; articulate sounds had fallen upon his ear, and he wished and vainly hoped that it was from her lips, and not from those of another, that they had proceeded. The few words which constitute that dialogue of monosyllables which follows, would then require to be thus distributed. He asks, ‘Did not you speak?’ To which she replies, ‘When? Now?’ Both words spoken with an interrogative inflection. At what time do you mean that I spoke? Is it now? ‘As I descended.’ Then was the time that the articulate sounds were heard which he now wishes to have explained, and the words should stand without a note of interrogation. The ‘Ay’ of the lady then possesses an effect, which as the scene stands at present it wants.— BODENSTEDT: This whispering, so laconic and yet so heart-piercing, between the two who dare not meet each other’s eyes, belongs to the most powerful that the poetry of all ages and all times has created. But we must be on our guard against taking Macbeth’s question in lines 42, 43 as an expression of genuine repentance. It is not prompted by his conscience, but only by his imagination, whose irrepressible and ever-flowing tide bore before him all the horrors of the future. ... It is not the crime already done that horrifies him; it is only the distressing consequences which can spring from it.

        "COWDEN CLARKE: Hearke] The poetry of this exclamation, as Shakespeare has employed it in this appalling scene, has been strangely vulgarized into bare matter of fact by theatrical representation, which usually accompanies this exclamation of Macbeth by a clap of stage thunder. It appears to us that Macbeth’s ‘Hark’ here is of a piece with Lady Macbeth’s ‘Hark!’ which she twice utters just before. It is put into both their mouths to denote the anxious listening, the eager, sensitive ears, the breathless strain, with which each murderous accomplice hearkens after any sound that they dread should break the silence of night.",
        "HUNTER: This... sight] This interruption, though highly proper, and, indeed, a most natural and striking incident, draws off the mind from the connection between the question ‘Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?’ and what next follows, and prevents it from perceiving so clearly as it was to be desired, that the persons talking in their sleep who were overheard by Macbeth, as he returned from the murder which was committed overhead, lay in that second chamber,",
        "SKEAT: sorry] Now regarded as closely connected with sorrow, with which it has no etymological connection at all, though doubtless the confusion between the words is of old standing. The spelling sory with two r’s is etymologically wrong, and due to the shortening of the o; the o was originally long; and the true form is sov-y, which is nothing but the substantive sove with the suffix -y (Anglo-Saxon -zg), formed exactly like ston-y from stone, bon-y from bone, and gor-y from gore (which has not yet been turned into gorry). We find the spelling soarye as late as in Stanyhurst, trans. of Virgil, [1582], Aen, ii, 651, ed. Arber, p. 64, 1. 18, The original sense was wounded, afflicted, and hence miserable, sad, pitiable, as in the expression ‘in a sorry plight.’ Compare: Oth.

I used to think that the natural companion of Donalbain would be Malcolm, his brother; and that the two brothers woke in horror from the proximity of their father’s murderer, who was just passing the door. A friend objected to this, that, had they been together, Malcolm, being the elder, would have been mentioned rather than Donalbain. Accept this objection, and we find a yet more delicate significance: the presence operated differently on the two, one bursting out in a laugh, the other crying murder; but both were in terror when they awoke, and dared not sleep till they had said their prayers.

It was a cherub, one of the ‘young and rosy cherubim’ of heaven. Macbeth invests it with its proper attributes, and would have gone on expatiating on its gentle and valuable qualities, but Lady Macbeth interrupts him, and asks with unaffected surprise, ‘What do you mean?’ He proceeds in the same distempered strain, not so much answering her question, as continuing to give expression to the feeling of horror at the thought which had fixed itself in his mind, that he had committed a defeat on the useful and innocent Sleep; and he repeats what the voice appeared to him to have said, with the additional circumstance that the voice seemed to pervade the apartments of his spacious castle, like the limbs of the great giant which lay in the Castle of Otranto, and that it would enter other ears than his, and lead to the discovery of his crime. And he comes at length to the horrible conviction that a punishment which bore relation to the nature of his offence would soon fall upon him [lines 54, 55]. In this scene we have, perhaps, as highly wrought a tragical effect as is to be found in the whole range of the ancient or modern drama.’",

It is rather an instance of merely excited imagination without sensual representation, like the ‘ suggestion’ in I, iii, 150.

      "play": "MACBETH: Whence is that knocking?",
      "notes": [
        "De QUINCEY: Knocke within] From my boyish days I had always felt a great perplexity on one point in Macbeth. It was this: the knocking at the gate, which succeeds to the murder of Duncan, produced to my feelings an effect for which I never could account. The effect was, that it reflected back upon the murder a peculiar awfulness and a depth of solemnity; yet, however obstinately I endeavored with my understanding to comprehend this, for many years I never could see why it should produce such an effect.... At length I solved [the problem] to my own satisfaction; and my solution is this: Murder, in ordinary cases, where the sympathy is wholly directed to the case of the murdered person, is an incident of coarse and vulgar horror; and for this reason, that it flings the interest exclusively upon the natural but ignoble instinct by which we cleave to life; an instinct, which, as being indispensable to the primal law of self-preservation, is the same in kind (though different in degree) amongst all living creatures; this instinct, therefore, because it annihilates all distinctions, and degrades the greatest of men to the level of the ‘poor beetle that we tread on,’ exhibits human nature in its most abject and humiliating attitude. Such an attitude would little suit the purposes of the Poet. What then must he do? He must throw the interest on the murderer. Our sympathy must be with him, (of course, I mean a sympathy of comprehension, a sympathy by which we enter into his feelings, and are made to understand them—not a sympathy of pity or approbation). In the murdered person, all strife of thought, all flux and reflux of passion and of purpose, are crushed by one overwhelming panic; the fear of instant death smites him ‘with its petrific mace.’ But in the murderer, such a murderer as a poet will condescend to, there must be raging some great storm of passion,—jealousy, ambition, vengeance, hatred,—which will create a hell within him; and into this hell we are to look. In Macbeth, for the sake of gratifying his own enormous and teeming faculty of creation, Shakespeare has introduced two murderers, and, as usual in his hands, they are remarkably discriminated; but, though in Macbeth the strife of mind is greater than in his wife, the tiger spirit not so awake, and his feelings caught chiefly by contagion from her,—yet, as both were finally involved in the guilt of murder, the murderous mind of necessity is finally to be presumed in both. This was to be expressed; and on its own account, as well as to make it a more proportionable antagonist to the unoffending nature of their victim, ‘the gracious Duncan,’ and adequately to expound the ‘deep damnation of his taking off,’ this was to be expressed with peculiar energy. We were to be made to feel that the human nature—i. e. the divine nature of love and mercy, spread through the hearts of all creatures, and seldom utterly withdrawn from man—was gone, vanished, extinct; and that the fiendish nature had taken its place. And, as this effect is marvellously accomplished in the dialogues and soliloquies themselves, so it is finally consummated by the expedient under consideration; and it is to this that I now solicit the reader’s attention. If the reader has ever witnessed a wife, daughter, or sister in a fainting fit, he may chance to have observed that the most affecting moment in such a spectacle is that in which a sigh or a stirring announces the recommencement of suspended life. Or, if the reader has ever been present in a vast metropolis on the day when some great national idol was carried in funeral pomp to his grave, and chancing to walk near the course through which it passed, has felt powerfully, in the silence and desertion of the streets, and in the stagnation of ordinary business, the deep interest which at that moment was possessing the heart of man,—if all at once he should hear the death-like stillness broken up by the sound of wheels rattling away from the scene, and making known that the transitory vision was dissolved, he will be aware that at no moment was his sense of the complete suspension and pause in ordinary human concerns so full and affecting as at that moment when the suspension ceases, and the goings-on of human life are suddenly resumed. All action in any direction is best expounded, measured,~ and made apprehensible by reaction. Now apply this to the case of Macbeth. Here, as I have said, the retiring of the human heart, and the entrance of the fiendish heart, was to be expressed and made sensible. Another world has stept in, and the murderers are taken out of the region of human things, human purposes, human desires. They are transfigured: Lady Macbeth is ‘unsexed’; Macbeth has forgot that he was born of woman; both are conformed to the image of devils; and the world of devils is suddenly revealed. But how shall this be conveyed and made palpable? In order that a new world may step in, this world must for a time disappear. The murderers, and the murder, must be insulated,—cut off by an immeasurable gulf from the ordinary tide and succession of human affairs,—locked up and sequestered in some deep recess; we must be made sensible that the world of ordinary life is suddenly arrested,—laid asleep, tranced,—racked into a dread armistice; time must be annihilated; relation to things without abolished; and all must pass self-withdrawn into a deep syncope and suspension of earthly passion. Hence it is, that when the deed is done, when the work of darkness is perfect, then the world of darkness passes away like a pageantry in the clouds: the knocking at the gate is heard; and it makes known audibly that the reaction has commenced; the human has made its reflux upon the fiendish; the pulses of life are beginning to beat again; and the re-establishment of the goings-on of the world in which we live, first makes us profoundly sensible of the awful parenthesis that had suspended them.—[E. K. CHAMBERS: The knocking here seems to show that the opening of the next scene always formed part of the play. Macbeth is not sure at first if it is real or ‘fantastic.’—ED. ii.]",
        "BELL: Whence is that knocking?] Kemble plays well here; stands motionless; his bloody hands near his face; his eyes fixed; agony in his brow; quite rooted to the spot. [Mrs Siddons] at first directs him with an assumed and confident air. Then alarm steals over her, increasing to agony, lest his reason be quite gone, and discovery be inevitable. She strikes him on the shoulder, pulls him from his fixed posture, forces him away; he talking as he goes.—ED. ii."

If, however, this allusion be not intended, I believe, by the ‘ multitudinous seas’ was meant, not the many-waved ocean, but the countless masses of waters wherever dispersed on the surface of the globe, the ‘ multitude of seas,’ as Heywood has it ; and indeed it must be owned that the plural, seas, seems to countenance such a supposition.— STEEVENS: I believe that Shakespeare referred to some visible quality in the ocean, rather than to its concealed inhabitants; to the waters that might admit of some discoloration, and not to the fishes, whose hue could suffer no change from the tinct of blood. Waves appearing over waves are no inapt symbol of a crowd. If therefore Shakespeare does not mean the aggregate of seas, he must be understood to design the multitude of waves."

Both Spalding and Hickson attribute this scene to Shakespeare.—ED. ii. ]—MURPHY: Garrick was for some time in the habit of saying: the green-one red; but, upon consideration, he adopted the alteration which was first proposed by this writer in the Gray’s Inn Journal [i, 100].—MALONE: Every part of the line, as punctuated by Murphy, appears to me exceptionable. One red does not sound to my ear as the phraseology of the age of Elizabeth; and the green, for the green one, or for the green sea, is, I am persuaded, unexplained.—STEEVENS: If Murphy’s punctuation be dismissed, we must correct the foregoing line, and read: ‘The multitudinous sea’; for how will the plural, seas, accord with the—‘ green one?’ Besides, the new punctuation is countenanced by a passage in Hamlet, II, ii, 479: ‘ Now is he total gules.’ Again in Milton’s Comus, 133: ‘And makes one blot of all the air.’—NARES: Shakespeare surely meant only ‘making the green sea red.’ The other interpretation, which implies its making ‘the green [sea] one entire red,’ seems to me ridiculously harsh and forced. The punctuation of the Ff supports the more natural construction.—COLLIER (ed. i.): Although the old pointing can be no rule, it may be some guide, and we therefore revert to what we consider the natural, and what was probably the ancient, mode of delivering the words.—LETTSOM (ed. ii.): The MS Corrector strikes out the comma after ‘one.’ In the same way, in Beaumont & Fletcher’s Maid of the Mill (ed. Dyce, ix, 280), Otrante ought to say: ‘ How I freeze together, And am one ice’; but all editors, including the last, have allowed the last hemistich to remain, ‘And am on ice,’ as if Otrante had meant, not that he freezed together and was ‘one ice,’ but merely that he stood upon ice.—Dyce: Here Collier proposes a highly probable correction: but let me say, in excuse of the editors of Beaumont & Fletcher, that they supposed ‘on ice’ might be a similar expression to ‘on fire.’—WHITE: Was the power of mere punctuation [in the Folio] to turn the sublime into the ridiculous ever before so strikingly exemplified! [‘Very true’ is Lettsom’s MS marginal comment on the foregoing in the present editor’s copy of the volume.—ED.]—CLARENDON: Converting the green into one uniform red. The comma after ‘one’ yields a tame, not to say ludicrous, sense."

        "Vischer: Enter a Porter] With the keen insight of the artist Shakespeare accentuates the effect of the knocking by the Porter’s sleepy hesitation. 4-22: Coleridge: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] This low soliloquy of the Porter, and his few speeches afterwards, I believe to have been written for the mob by some other hand, perhaps with Shakespeare’s consent; and that finding it take, he with the remaining ink of a pen otherwise employed, just interpolated the words [’l’... donjire, lines 19-21]. Of the rest not one syllable has the ever-present being of Shakespeare. 4-22: Clarendon: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] Probably Coleridge would not have made even this exception unless he had remembered Hamlet, I, iii, 50. To us this comic scene, not of a high class of comedy at best, seems strangely out of place amidst the tragic horrors which surround it, and is quite different in effect from the comic passages which Shakespeare has introduced into other tragedies— 4-22: Maginn: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] The speech of this porter is in blank verse. [The lines ending man—old—there,—farmer—expectation—enough—knock!—[I] faith— swear—[one] who—yet—in,—there?—hither—tailor,—quiet.—hell.—thought— professions,—everlasting darkness (sic).—Ed.] The alterations I propose are very slight: upon for \"on,\" i’faith for \"’faith,\" and the introduction of the word one in a place where it is required. The succeeding dialogue is also in blank verse. 4-22: Heraud: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] Nothing more admirably fitted than this scene for the purpose of supplying the transition from one point of effect to another could be given; and any critical censure of the Poet, for what he has here done, results from ignorance of his art. The true dramatist will estimate it at its true worth. 4-22: Bodenstedt: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] After all, his uncouth comicality has a tragic background; he never dreams, while imagining himself a porter of hell-gate, of how near he comes to the truth. What are all these petty sinners who go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire compared with those great criminals whose gates he guards? 4-22: Wordsworth: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] As I do not doubt the passage was written with earnestness, and with a wonderful knowledge of human nature, especially as put into the mouth of a drunken man, so I believe it may be read with edification. 4-22: Collier: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] In the (MS) these lines are struck out, perhaps, as offensive to the Puritans. 4-22: F. J. Furnivall: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] What can be more natural and happy than that a Porter should say some grimly humourous words about his own calling; and that he should wind up with that, ‘I pray you, remember the Porter’—his fee! Wasn’t all Scotland begging for English posts and fees from 1603 to 1607, or whenever Macbeth was written? How could a Scotch Porter be better hit off? Surely he must be a dull soul who can’t see the humour of this character 4-22: W. Leighton: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] For several reasons, viz: blundering in respect to time; something un-Shakespearian in the porter,—as style and certain words nowhere else used by that author,—unusual coarseness in a play otherwise correct in such respect; and similarity with Middleton’s work—for these reasons combined, there is certainly cause to suspect that the latter author patched Shakespeare’s play at this place, and did it unskilfully 4-22: Hales: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] There are five points which should be thoroughly considered before any final verdict is pronounced, as to whether the Porter is not, after all, a genuine offspring of Shakespeare’s art. (i) That a Porter’s speech is an integral part of the play. (ii) That it is necessary as a relief to the surrounding horror. (iii) That it is necessary according to the law of contrast elsewhere obeyed. (iv) That the speech we have is dramatically relevant. (v) That its style and language are Shakespearian. (i) No one will deny that the knocking scene is an integral part of the play.... But with the knocking the porter is inseparably associated. If we retain it, we must retain him. And if we retain him, he must surely make a speech of some sort; or are we to picture to ourselves a profoundly dumb functionary? Are we to conceive him as crossing the stage, perhaps brandishing his keys with a mysterious cunning, but with tongue fast tied and bound? There is probably no student of Shakespeare who is prepared to accept such a phenomenon. Clearly, then, the porter speaks, to whatever effect. (ii) That some speech of a lighter kind is necessary to relieve the surrounding horror. Now if ever in the plays of Shakespeare some relaxation is needed for the nerves strained to the utmost; if ever some respite and repose are due to prevent the high mysterious delight corrupting into a morbid panic, it is so in the terrible scene now before us. A monotony of horror cannot be sustained; and any disturbance of it is infinitely welcome. The sound of a fresh voice after we have listened so long to that guilty conference is a very cordial. ... (iii) Some lighter speech is necessary according to the law of contrast elsewhere observed by Shakespeare. To the true humourist the various colours of life are inextricably woven. It is all infinitely sad and infinitely comic. The beauty of summer and the blackness of winter, the gladness of life and the dulness of death. These are omnipresent with him. And so in the Shakespearian drama we find strange neighborhoods. Jesters and jesting in the midst of that stupendous storm in King Lear! In Hamlet the grave-digger is one with the clown. In Othello, amidst all its bitter earnest, there are foolings and railleries. In fact, Macbeth would be unique among the tragedies of Shakespeare if the comic element were utterly absent from it. (iv) The speech of the Porter is dramatically relevant. The whole speech is, in fact, a powerful piece of irony. ‘If a man were porter of hell-gate.’ But is this man not so? What then is hell? and where are its gates?...It may be well to notice here that the Porter of Hell was a not unfamiliar figure in the old Mysteries. We find in Virgil, indeed, what might have suggested some such functionary to the medieval mind. Virgil speaks of Cerberus as ‘Janitor’ (Ænid, vi, 400) and as ‘Janitor Orci’ (Æn. viii, 296). Fletcher also, in his Honest Man’s Fortune (III, ii.), speaks of ‘hell’s three-headed porter.’ It was natural enough, when so much was talked of St. Peter with his keys keeping the gate of Heaven, that there should be conceived an infernal counterpart of that celestial functionary. (v) Are the style and language of the Porter’s speech Shakespearian? Surely the fancy, which is the main part of the Porter’s speech, must be allowed to be eminently after the manner of Shakespeare. He was well acquainted with the older stage, as his direct references to it show (see Twelfth Night, IV, ii; 2 Hen. IV: II, iv; Hamlet, III, ii); and this conception of an infernal janitor is just such a piece of antique realism as he would delight in. He has it elsewhere; see Oth. IV, ii, 90. The manner in which Macduff ‘draws out’ the Porter is exactly like that of Shakespeare in similar circumstances elsewhere. Compare the way in which Orlando is made to elicit the wit of Rosalind, [As You Like It, III, ii, 323 et seq.]. If this likeness of manner has no great positive, yet it has some negative, value. We see that the manner is not un-Shakespearian, if it cannot be pronounced definitely Shakespearian; and we need not go to Middleton’s plays for an illustration of it. The passage is written in the rhythmic prose that is so favourite a form with Shakespeare (see Hen. V. II, iii, 9-28). And as for the language, there is certainly nothing in it un- Shakespearian. The general conclusion justified by what has been advanced seems to me to be this: that the Porter is undoubtedly a part of the original play, and that the general conception of his speech is certainly Shakespeare’s: with regard to the expression, that part of it is most certainly his, and, for the rest, no sufficient reason has yet been urged to countenance any doubt that it too is by Shakespeare. 4-22: R. G. White: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] This Porter I was once misled into believing, for a little while, to be not of Shakespeare’s make. I was wrong. He is one of Shakespeare’s true humourous grotesques, although not of the best sort of them. Of the knocking that he prates about, what a woful echo in Lady Macbeth’s sleep-walking scene! and, by her pallid lips, Shakespeare claims him for his own: this scene is surely all of one piece. 4-22: Hudson: Here’s a knocking indeede: etc.] Coleridge thinks this part of the scene could not have been written by Shakespeare. ... I am sure it is like him, I think it is worthy of him, and would by no means have it away."

        "Steevens: Hose] Warburton said this at random. The French hose (according to Stubbes in his Anatomie of Abuses) were in 1595 much in fashion: ‘The Gallic hosen are made very large and wide, reaching down to their knees only, with three or foure gardes apeece laid down along either hose,’ [p. 56, ed. Furnivall.—Ed. ].",
        "Farmer: Hose] Steevens forgot the uncertainty of French fashions. In The Treasury of Ancient and Modern Times, 1613, we have an account (from Guyon, I suppose) of the old French dresses: ‘(ens hose answered in length to their short-skirted doublets; being made close to their limbes, wherein they had no means for pockets.’",
        "Clarendon: Hose] Stubbes, in his Anatomie of Abuses (fol. 23 b, ed. 1585), says: ‘The Frenche hose are of two diuers makinges, for the common Frenche hose (as they list to call them) containeth length, breadth, and sidenesse sufficient, and is made very rounde. The other contayneth neyther length, breadth, nor sidenesse (being not past a quarter of a yarde side), whereof some be paned, cut, and drawen out with costly ornamentes, with Canions annexed, reaching downe beneath their knees.’ In the Afer. of Ven. I, ii, 80, Shakespeare clearly speaks of the larger kind, the ‘round hose’ which the Englishman borrows from France, and it is enough to suppose that the tailor merely followed the practice of his trade without exhibiting any special dexterity in stealing. In Hen. V- III, vii, 56, the French hose are wide by comparison."

The etymological spelling bone-fire, Sc. bane-fire, was common down to 1760, though ‘bonfire’ was also in use from the sixteenth century, and became more common as the original sense was forgotten. Johnson in 1755 decided for bonefire, ‘from bon, good, and fire.’ But the shortening of the vowel was natural, from its position; cf. knowledge, Monday, collier, etc. In Scotland with the form bane-fire, the memory of the original sense was retained longer; for the annual midsummer ‘banefire’ or ‘bonefire’ in the burgh of Hawick, old bones were regularly collected and stored up, down to about 1800.

        "Malone: Night] It is not very easy to ascertain precisely the time when Duncan is murdered. The conversation that passes between Banquo and Macbeth, in II, i, might lead us to suppose that when Banquo retired to rest it was not much after twelve o’clock. The king was then ‘abed’; and, immediately after Banquo retires Lady Macbeth strikes upon the bell, and Macbeth commits the murder. In a few minutes afterwards the knocking at the gate commences, and no time can be supposed to elapse between the second and the third scene, because the Porter gets up in consequence of the knocking: yet here Macduff talks of last night, and says that he was commanded to call timely on the king, and that he fears he has almost overpass’d the hour; and the Porter tells him, ‘We were carousing till the second cock’; so that we must suppose it to be now at least six o’clock; for Macduff has already expressed his surprise that the Porter should lie so late. From Lady Macbeth’s words in Act V, ‘One—two—’ tis time to do’t,’ it should seem that the murder was committed at two o’clock, and that hour is certainly not inconsistent with the conversation above referred to between Banquo and his son; but even that hour of two will not correspond with what the Porter and Macduff say in the present scene. I suspect Shakespeare in fact meant that the murder should be supposed to be committed a little before daybreak, which exactly corresponds with the speech of Macduff now before us, though not so well with the other circumstances already mentioned, or with Lady Macbeth’s desiring her husband to put on his night-gown. Shakespeare, I believe, was led to fix the time of Duncan’s murder near the break of day by Holinshed’s account of the murder of King Duffe: ‘—he was long in his oratorie, and there continued till it was /ate in the night.’ Donwald’s servants ‘enter the chamber where the king laie, a “little before cocks crow, where they secretlie cut his throat.’"

        "Scott (iii, 35): Enter Macbeth] We can never forget the rueful horror of [Kemble’s] look, which by strong exertion he endeavors to conceal, when on the morning succeeding the murder he receives Lenox and Macduff in the ante-chamber of Duncan. His efforts to appear composed, his endeavors to assume the attitude and appearance of one listening to Lenox’s account of the external terrors of the night, while in fact he is expecting the alarm to arise within the royal apartment, formed a most astonishing piece of playing. Kemble’s countenance seemed altered by the sense of internal horror, and had a cast of that of Count Ugolino in the dungeon, as painted by Reynolds. When Macbeth felt himself obliged to turn towards Lenox and reply to what he had been saying, you saw him, like a man awaking from a fit of absence, endeavor to recollect at least the general tenor of what had been said, and it was some time ere he could bring out the general reply, ‘’Twas a rough night.’ Those who have had the good fortune to see Kemble and Mrs Siddons as Macbeth and his lady, may be satisfied they have witnessed the highest perfection of the dramatic art.—ED. ii.—Knowles (p. 55): The actor who betrays to the audience in any portion of this scene the slightest evidence of desperation or forgetfulness on the part of Macbeth, errs most egregiously from true judgment. The audience require no hint as to what is passing in Macbeth’s bosom, nor is there a moment’s opportunity for by-play, as it is called, to render the thing feasible. He is kept in close conversation from first to last. If he is on his guard with respect to one of the visitors, be sure he is equally so with respect to both. How absurd is it, then, for an actor to require that this question shall be repeated, as if, absorbed in his expectation of what is coming, Macbeth did not hear it in the first instance. Macbeth’s mind being once roused to the necessity of playing his part, the imminency of his danger keeps it broad awake. He would as soon betray himself to Lenox by standing gasping after Macduff, as he would betray himself to Macduff by being abstracted when the Thane inquires if the King is stirring yet? When the discovery of the murder came, would not Lenox recollect the statue he had spoken to, and guess the cause which had turned Macbeth for the time into a stone? The frame of mind in which we now find Macbeth would rather induce him to overdo than to fall short. Here is again the mischief of studying partial effects. Howsoever calm Macbeth may appear without, the storm shall not only be kept up within, but with aggravated strife.—ED. ii."

        "Johnson: New hatch’d] A prophecy of an event new hatch’d seems to be a prophecy of an event past. And a prophecy new hatch’d is a wry expression. The term new hatch’d is properly applicable to a bird, and that birds of ill omen should be new hatch’d to the woful time, that is, should appear in uncommon numbers, is very consistent with the rest of the prodigies here mentioned.—Heath (p. 388): Johnson, on review, would ‘scarce approve of the owlet hooting from the moment it was hatched, and filling that whole night with its clamours.—Steevens : ‘Prophecying’ is what is ‘new hatch’d,’ and in the metaphor holds the place of the egg. The ‘events’ are the fruit of such hatching. —Malone: The following passage in which the same imagery is found, inclines me to believe that our author meant that ‘new hatch’d’ should be referred to events, though the events were yet to come. Allowing for his usual inaccuracy with respect to the active and passive participle, the events may be said to be ‘the hatch and brood of time.’ See 2 Hen. IV. III, i, 82: ‘The which observed, a man may prophesy, With a near aim, of the main chance of things As yet not come to life, which in their seeds And weak beginnings lie entreasured. Such things become the hatch and brood of time.’ Here certainly it is the thing or event, and not the prophecy, which is the hatch of time; but it must be acknowledged, the word ‘become’ sufficiently marks the future time. If therefore the construction that I have suggested be the true one, ‘hatch’d’ must be here used for hatching, or in the state of being hatch’d.—To the woful time’ means—to suit the woful time.—Knight: We have adopted a punctuation, suggested by a friend, which connects ‘the obscure bird’ with ‘prophesying.’—Clarendon: The extract above given from 2 Hen. IV: III, i, 82, shows that the ordinary punctuation is right. ‘Hatch’d to the time’ may either be used like born to the time, i.e. the time’s brood, or hatched to suit the time, as ‘to’ is used, Coriol.

In the scene of the discovery Macbeth is perfectly at home: energetic action is needed, and he is dealing with men. His acted innocence appears to me better than his wife’s; Lady Macbeth goes near to suggesting a personal interest in the crime by her over-anxiety to disclaim it, Yet in this scene, as everywhere else, the weak points in Macbeth’s character betray him: for one moment he is left to himself, and that moment’s suspense ruins the whole episode. The sense of crisis proves too much for him, and under an ungovernable impulse he stabs the grooms. He thus wrecks the whole scheme. How perfectly Lady Macbeth’s plan would have served if it had been left to itself is shown by Lenox’s account of what he had seen.—ED. ii."

In proof of this, we may observe that the Hemistich ending Macduff’s Speech and that beginning Lady Macbeth’s make up a complete Verse. Now, if ‘Ring the bell’ had been part of the Text, can we imagine that Shakespeare would have begun the Lady’s speech with a broken Line?—Malone: It should be remembered that stage-directions were often couched in imperative terms: ‘Draw a knife,’ ‘Play musick,’ ‘Ring the bell,’ etc. In the Folio we have here indeed also, ‘Bell rings,’ as a marginal direction; but this was inserted from the players misconceiving what Shakespeare had in truth set down in his copy as a dramatic direction to the property man, for a part of Macduff’s speech; and to distinguish the direction which they inserted, from the supposed words of the speaker, they departed from the usual imperative form. Throughout the whole of the preceding scene we have constantly an imperative direction to the prompter: ‘Knock within.—Knight: But how natural is it that Macduff, having previously cried, ‘Ring the alarum bell,’ should repeat the order!

        "Knowles (p. 57): Enter Lady] And now let us inquire how the presence of Lady Macbeth can be dispensed with at this juncture. Would she take a share in every other scene of the tragic enterprise, and absent herself from this last and most critical one? As the mistress of the castle, why should she keep her room while her stairs and corridors are thronged with the rush of feet in amazeful haste? Would it not be suspicious that, while the whole castle is afoot, the mistress of it should remain sitting? There is every reason for Lady Macbeth’s co- operation in this scene, and not one for her absence, except the reason of the actress who personates Lady Macbeth, that it is not worth while to come on for three or four times for the mere sake of probability and propriety. Our stage has been injured, and the taste of our audiences vitiated by the studying of mere effect. Shakespeare perfectly well knew where Lady Macbeth or any other woman would be found at such a juncture. Not in her bed- chamber, but in her hall, in the very midst of the hurly-burly. And there he has placed her, to suffer the rebuke of the actor, to be told most ignorantly that she has no business there, and to be sent to her chamber again, where if even on account of her mere anxiety as to the issue, she could not have remained.—ED. ii.—Fletcher (p. 164): The total omission of Lady Macbeth in this scene is a theatrical mutilation which involves a doubly gross improbability. On the one hand, the lady’s clear understanding of the part it behooves her to act, and her perfect self-possession, must of themselves bring her forward as the mistress of the mansion. On the other hand, her solicitude to see how her nervous lord conducts himself under this new trial of his self-possession, so vital to them both, must force her upon the scene. Besides, this one brief suppression strikes out one complete link in the main dramatic interest. ED. ii. [Fletcher doubtless refers to the acting version as given in Inchbald’s British Theatre. Irving restored Lady Macbeth to this scene. Booth followed the older version.—ED. ii. ]"

And who doubts that he is not only heartened, but inspired by her presence? He gasps while he replies: ‘Who can be wise, amazed, temperate, and furious, In a moment? No man.’ The danger is warded off for the time. By this last act of boldness and self-collectedness, he atones for all past remissness and vacillation. Her spirit is reassured. Her presence is now no longer necessary. She affects natural exhaustion, and cries to be assisted out.—ED. ii. 133-143: Vischer (Vorträge, ii, p. 93): Mnemonic] It is apparent that he is acting a part. But how is it with him in reality? His natural self seeks relief from the weight of its disguising mask. He is ever full to overflowing with fantastic images. In order to counterfeit it is only needful for him to be his own true self, and he will act the part well.

It is not improbable that Shakespeare put these forced and unnatural metaphors into the mouth of Macbeth, as a mark of artifice and dissimulation, to show the difference between the studied language of hypocrisy and the natural outcries of sudden passion. This whole speech, so considered, is a remarkable instance of judgement, as it consists entirely of antithesis and metaphor.—Steevens: The allusion is to the decoration of the richest habits worn in the age of Shakespeare, when it was usual to lace cloth of silver with gold, and cloth of gold with silver. The second of these fashions is mentioned in Much Ado, III, iv, 19 —Harry Rowe: The other day, my wooden Macbeth declared in the green-room that this line was nonsense. Being old enough to know the folly of disputing with a blockhead, I only desired him to favour me with a better. He accordingly repeated: ‘His snow-white skin streaked with his crimson blood.’ This, though not an extraordinary good line, has something like sense to recommend it.—Abbott (§ 529): A metaphor must not be far-fetched nor dwell upon the details of a disgusting picture, as in these lines. There is but little, and that far-fetched, similarity between gold lace and blood, or between bloody daggers and breech’d legs. The slightness of the similarity, recalling the greatness of the dissimilarity, disgusts us with the attempted comparison."

They were unmanly stain’d with blood, because such stains are often most honourable.—Johnson: An ‘unmannerly’ dagger and a dagger ‘breech’d’ are expressions not easily to be understood. There are undoubtedly two faults here which I have endeavoured to take away by reading: ‘Unmanly drench’d with gore,’ —I saw drench’d with the king's blood not only instruments of murder but evidences of cowardice. ... Warburton’s emendation is perhaps right.—Jennens: Shakespeare’s first thought might have been: ‘Their naked daggers were covered with gore.’ Nakedness suggested the word ‘unmannerly,’ and covered the word ‘breeches,’ the covering of nakedness.—Farmer: That is, sheath’d with blood. In the 6th Dialogue of Erondell’s french Garden, 1605 (which I am persuaded Shakespeare read in the English, and from which he took, as he supposed, this quaint expression), we have: ‘Boy, go fetch your master’s silver- hatched daggers, you have not brushed their breeches, bring the brushes,’ etc. Shakespeare was deceived by the pointing, and evidently supposes breeches to be a new and affected term for scabbards.—Heath (Revisal, etc. p. 388): Seward in his Notes on Beaumont & Fletcher, i, p. 380, and ii, p. 276, mentions another interpretation: ‘Stained with gore up to the breeches, that is, to their hilts.’ But, as he justly observes, the lower end of a cannon is called its breech, yet the breech of a dagger is an expression which could not be used with propriety. He conjectures the true reading to have been hatch’d, that is, gilt; and adduces some instances from Fletcher which seem fully to prove the use of the word in that signification.... My own conjecture is: ‘In a manner lay drench’d with gore.’ The qualifying form of expression, in a manner, seems to have a peculiar propriety. A dagger cannot imbibe blood, nor be saturated with it like a sponge, which is the idea conveyed by the word drench’d, but it may appear as if it were so.—Douce: The present expression, though in itself something unmannerly, simply means covered as with breeches.—Nares: Instead of concluding with Farmer that Shakespeare had seen that passage from Erondell and mistaken it, we should use it to confirm the true explanation, viz.: ‘Having their very hilt, or breech, covered with blood.’ Sheaths of daggers are wiped, not brushed, and Shakespeare could not have supposed them to be here meant; it was evidently the silver hatching that required the brush. We cannot, however, conceive of Shakespeare looking for paltry authorities, or even thinking of them when he poured forth his rapid lines. He doubtless took up the metaphor as it occurred to him without further reflection.—Dyce (Gloss.): Probably Douce is right.—Clarendon: We doubt not the blade, and not the handle, is meant. Compare Twelfth Night, III, iv, 274."

        "Whateley (p. 77, note): hoa] On Lady Macbeth’s seeming to faint, while Banquo and Macduff are solicitous about her, Macbeth, by his unconcern, betrays a consciousness that the fainting is feigned. —Malone: A bold and hardened villain would, from a refined policy, have assumed the appearance of being alarmed about her, lest this very imputation should arise against him. The irresolute Macbeth is not sufficiently at ease to act such a part.— Fletcher (p. 129): Remembering the burst of anguish which had been forced from her by Macbeth’s very first ruminations upon his act: ‘These deeds must not be thought after these ways; so, it will make us mad,’ [II, ii, 45], it will be seen what a dreadful accumulation of suffering is inflicted on her by her husband’s own lips, painting in stronger, blacker colours than ever, the guilty horror of their common deed. Even her indomitable resolution may well sink for the moment under a stroke so withering, for which, being totally unexpected, she came so utterly unprepared. It is remarkable that, upon her exclamation of distress, Macduff, and shortly after, Banquo, cries out, ‘Look to the lady’; but that we find not the smallest sign of attention paid to her situation by Macbeth himself, who, arguing from his own character to hers, might regard it merely as a dexterous feigning on her part. A character like this, we cannot too often repeat, is one of the most cowardly selfishness and most remorseless treachery, which all its poetical excitability does but exasperate into the perpetration of more and more extravagant enormities.—Horn (i, 66): Lady Macbeth’s amiable powers give way, and the swoon is real. It moreover gives us an intimation of her subsequent fate.—[Wilson (p. 637): Buller. Is Lady Macbeth’s swooning, at the close of her husband’s most graphic picture of the position of the corpses, real or pretended? Seward. Real. Tadboys. Pretended. Buller. Sir? Orth. I reserve my opinion. Tadboys. Not a faint—but a feint. She cannot undo that which is done; nor hinder that which he will do next. She must mind her own business. Now distinctly her own business—is to faint. A high-bred, sensitive, innocent Lady, startled from her sleep to find her guest and King murdered, and the room full of aghast nobles, cannot possibly do anything else but faint. Lady Macbeth, who ‘all particulars of duty knows,’ faints accordingly. Orth. Seward, we are ready to hear you. Seward. She has been about a business that must have somewhat shook her nerves— granting them to be of iron. She would herself have murdered Duncan had he not resembled her Father as he slept; and on sudden discernment of that dreadful resemblance, her soul must have shuddered, if her body served her to stagger away from parricide. On the deed being done, she is terrified after a different manner from the doer of the deed; but her terror is as great; and though she says: ‘The sleeping and the dead are but as pictures—’tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted Devil,’ believe me that her face was like ashes, as she returned to the chamber to gild the faces of the grooms with the dead man’s blood. That knocking, too, alarmed the Lady—believe me—as much as her husband; and to keep cool and collected before him, so as to be able to support him at that moment with her advice, must have tried the utmost strength of her nature. Call her Fiend—she was a Woman. Down stairs she comes—and stands among them all, at first like one alarmed only—astounded by what she hears—and striving to simulate the ignorance of the innocent—‘What, in our house?’ ‘Too cruel anywhere!’ What she must have suffered then Shakespeare lets us conceive for ourselves; and what on her husband’s elaborate description of his inconsiderate additional murders. ‘The whole is too much for her’—she ‘is perplexed, in the extreme’—and the sinner swoons. Orth. Seward suggests a bold, strong, deep, tragical turn of the scene—that she faints actually. Well—so be it. ... If she faints really, and against her will, having forcible reasons for holding her will clear, she must be shown fighting, to the last effort of will, against the assault of womanly nature, and drop, vanquished, as one dead, without a sound. But the Thaness calls out lustily—she remembers, “as we shall make our griefs and clamours roar upon his death.’ She makes noise enough—takes good care to attract everybody’s attention to her performance—for which I commend her. Calculate as nicely as you will—she distracts or diverts speculation, and makes an interesting and agreeable break in the conversation—I think that the obvious meaning is the right meaning—and that she faints on purpose. ... Buller, In Davies, Anecdotes of the Stage, 1 remember reading that Garrick would not trust Mrs Pritchard with the Swoon. ... Therefore, by the Great Manager, Lady Macbeth was not allowed in the Scene to appear at all. His belief was, that with her Ladyship it was a feint. ...She was not, I verily believe, given to fainting— perhaps this was the first time she had ever fainted since she was a girl. Now I believe she did. She would have stood by her husband at all hazards had she been able, both on his account and her own; she would not have so deserted him at such a critical juncture; her character was of boldness rather than duplicity; her business now—her duty—was to brazen it out; but she grew sick—qualms of conscience, however terrible, can be borne by sinners standing upright at the mouth of hell—but the flesh of man is weak, in its utmost strength, when moulded to woman’s form—other qualms assail suddenly the earthly tenement—the breath is choked—the ‘distracted globe’ grows dizzy—they that look out of the windows know not what they see—the body reels, lapses, sinks, and at full length smites the floor. ... And nothing more likely to make a woman faint than that revelling and wallowing of his in that bloody description. Orth. By the Casting Vote of the President— faint.—W. W. Story (p. 278): At this point the two characters of Lady Macbeth and her husband cross each other. She has thus far only made the running for Macbeth, and he now takes up the race and passes her; she not only does not follow, but withdraws. Henceforth he rushes to his goal alone.—Moulton (p. 164): It matters little whether we suppose the fainting assumed, or that [Lady Macbeth] yields to the agitation she has been fighting so long. The point is that she chooses this exact moment for giving way: she holds out to the end of her husband’s speech, then falls with a cry for help; there is at once a diversion and she is‘carried out... . Lady Macbeth’s fainting saved her husband.—R. G. White (Studies in Sh. p. 70): Lady Macbeth saw at once that he had blundered in killing the men, and had thus attracted rather than diverted suspicion; and she saw also that he was overdoing his expression of grief and horror; and therefore instantly diverted attention from him by seeming to faint and by calling for assistance. She succeeded thus in diverting Macduff’s mind, and gained time for consultation.—Vischer (Vorträge, ii, p. 94): I am convinced that Shakespeare here wishes us to understand that this fainting of Lady Macbeth is partly real, partly feigned. She pretends to faint; and this was not difficult, because she was actually on the verge of so doing.—ED. ii."

Holinshed scarcely mentions the death of any of the ancient kings of Scotland without taking notice of their being buried with their predecessors in Colme-Aill.—MALONE: It is now called /colmkzi7/—KNIGHT: This little island, only three miles long and one and a half broad, was once the most important spot of the whole cluster of British Isles. It was inhabited by Druids previous to the year 563, when Colum M’Felim M’Fergus, afterwards called St. Columba, landed and began to preach Christianity. A monastery was soon established, and a noble cathedral built, of which the ruins still remain. The reputation of these establishments extended over the whole Christian world for some centuries, and devotees of rank strove for admission into them; the records of royal deeds were preserved there, and theré the bones of kings reposed. All the monarchs of Scotland, from Kenneth III. to Macbeth, inclusive—that is, from 973 to 1040—were buried at Iona. The island was several times laid waste by Danes and pirates, and the records which were saved were removed to Ireland, but the monastic, establishments survived and remained in honour till 1561, when the Act of the Convention of Estates doomed all monasteries to demolition. Such books and records as could be found in Iona were burnt, the tombs broken open, and the greater number of its hosts of crosses thrown down or carried away. In the cemetery, among the monuments of the founders and of many subsequent abbots, are three rows of tombs, said to be those of the Scottish, Irish, and Norwegian kings, in number reported to be forty-eight. For statements like these, however, there is no authority but tradition. Tradition itself does not pretend to individualize these tombs, so that the stranger must be satisfied with the knowledge that within the enclosure where he stands lie Duncan and Macbeth.—FRENCH (p. 297): It is said that forty-eight Scottish, four Irish, one French, and eight Norwegian kings are interred in Iona, besides many Lords of the Isles.",

This use is still retained. ‘The sooner the better,’ i. e. ‘By how much the sooner by so much the better.’ (Lat. ‘ guo citius, eo melius.’) It is sometimes stated that ‘the better’ is used by Shakespeare for ‘better,’ etc.: but it will often, perhaps always, be found that ‘the’ has a certain force. Thus in ‘7%e rather,’ IV, iii, 184, ‘the’ means ‘on that account.’ In the present instance Banquo is perhaps regarding his horse as racing against night, and ‘¢/e better’ means ‘ ¢he better of the two.’ In the passage from Stowe’s Survey [quoted above] the rider is perhaps described as endeavoring to anticipate the blow of the quintain by being ‘¢he faster’ of the two. Or more probably [as explained by Clarendon above]. In either case it is unscholarly to say that ‘the’ is redundant."

        "83. vtterance] JoHNson: This passage will be best explained by translating it into the language from whence the only word of difficulty in it is borrowed. ‘Que la destinée se rende en lice, et quelle me donne un defia \\outrance.’ A challenge, or a combat a /’ outrance,to extremity, was a fixed term in the law of arms, used when the combatants engaged with an odium internecinum, an intention to destroy each other, in opposition to trials of skill at festivals, or on other occasions, where the contest was only for reputation ora prize. The sense therefore is: Let fate, that has foredoomed the exaltation of the sons of Banquo, enter the lists against me, with the utmost animosity, in defence of its own decrees, which I will endeavour to invalidate, whatever be the danger.—CLARENDON: Cotgrave has: ‘Combatre a oultrance. To fight at sharpe, to fight it out, or to the vttermost; not to spare one another in fighting.’ Soin Holland’s Piny, ii, 26: *‘Germanicus Cesar exhibited a shew of sword-fencers at utterance.’"

The comic was wholly out of season. Shakespeare never introduces it, but when it may react on the tragedy by harmonious contrast.—[E. K. CHAMBERS: The murderers are former victims of Macbeth’s own, whom he has now induced to believe that they owe their wrongs to Banquo. Here again Macbeth’s histrionic skill, his power of playing upon the emotions of others, comes out. This passage is sufficient to show that Macbeth was not perfectly innocent and noble before the witches tempted him.—ED. ii. ]",

Let . . . welcome] CLARENDON: Theobald’s punctuation is doubtless right; it is solitude which gives a zest to society, not the being master of one’s time.—[D’ Hucugs: I have adopted the punctuation of F,, which thus rightly connects the words ‘to make society’ with the preceding phrase, and not with that which follows, as the punctuation of later editions would make it. Macbeth is speaking as a solicitous host who, in order to add to the pleasure of the evening reunion, grants to each and all the unrestrained use of his time. The other punctuation makes Macbeth say that he needs to be a few hours alone in order to enjoy the society of his friends.—Moserr.Ly : So Paradise Lost, ix, 230: ‘To short absence I could yield, For solitude sometimes is best society And short retirement urges quick return.’—ED. ii.]",

Genius] HEATH: Compare Ant. & C/eo, II, iii, 18: ‘Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side: Thy demon, that’s thy spirit which keeps thee, is Noble, courageous, high unmatchable, Where Czsar’s is not; but, near him, thy angel Becomes a fear, as being o’erpower'd.’—J. P. KEMBLE (p. 71): Antony feared Octavius as a political, not as a personal, enemy; and this is exactly the light in which Macbeth regards Banquo—as a rival for the sovereignty.— CLARENDON: The passage from Ant. & Cleo. is borrowed from North’s Plutarch, Antonius (p. 926, lines 8-10, ed. 1631): ‘For thy demon, said he (that is to say, the good angell and spirit that keepeth thee) is afraid of his: and being couragious and high when he is alone, becommeth fearfull and timorous when he cometh neare vnto the other.’—[ BAYNES (p. 270): Whatever the nature [of the rational soul], it rules, guards, keeps and controls the man, wielding the lower powers as instruments to its own issues. The poetical representations of this common view approach at times the more objective conception of the Greek or Socratic demon and the Roman genius, as the theological notion of distinct guardian or ruling spirits. In this passage from Macbeth the term may probably have, with the ordinary meaning, an objective reference of this kind. In Shakespeare, however, the terms angel and genius are usually employed to denote the higher nature of man, the rational guiding soul or spirit, which in connexion with the mortal instruments determines his character and fate. In Macbeth this spirit is that of insatiable and guilty ambition. It is this aspiring lawless genius that Banquo’s innate loyalty of heart and rectitude of purpose silently rebuked. This was the angel he still had served, whose evil whisperings had prepared him for the dark suggestions of the weird sisters, and inclined him to trust their fatal incantations. [See note fost, V, viii, 20.] But this may be easily misunderstood without some definite knowledge of the sense in which the term ‘angel’ is used.—Eb. ii.]",

        "157. perfect Spy] JoHNson: What is meant by this passage will be found difficult to explain; and therefore sense will be cheaply gained by a slight alteration. Macbeth is assuring the assassins that they shall not want directions to find Banquo, and therefore says: J wz// Acquaint you with a perfect spy o’ th’ time. Accordingly, a third murderer joins them afterwards at the place of action.—HEATH (p. 393): The word ‘spy’ is here used for essya/ or discovery, and the phrase means the exact intimation of the precise time, or as Shakespeare immediately interprets his own words, ‘the moment on’t.’? Johnson’s supposition that the ‘spy’ is the third murderer cannot be correct ; for Macbeth promises the two that he will make them acquainted with this perfect spy, which yet he is so far from doing, that the third murderer when he joins the others is absolutely unknown to them.—M. Mason : ‘With’ has here the force of 4y ; and the meaning of the passage is: ‘I will let you know, by the person best informed, of the exact moment in which the business is to be done.’—STEEVENS: This passage needs no reformation but that of a single point. After ‘ yourselves,’ in line 156, I place a full stop, as no further instructions could be given by Macbeth, the hour of Banquo’s return being quite uncertain. Macbeth therefore adds: ‘Acquaint you,’ etc., z. ¢. in ancient language, ‘acquaint yourse/ves’ with the exact time most favourable to your purposes ; for such a moment must be spied out by you, be selected by your own attention and scrupulous observation. Macbeth in the intervening time might have learned, from some of Banquo’s attendants, which way he had ridden out, and therefore could tell the murderers where to plant themselves so as to cut him off on his return; but who could ascertain the precise hour of his arrival, except the ruffians who watched for that purpose?—MALONE: The meaning, I think, is, I will acquaint you with the time when you may /oo% out for Banquo’s coming, with the most Zerfect assurance ef not being disappointed; and not only with the ¢me in general most proper for lying in wait for him, but with the very #oment when you may expect him.—Boswell: I apprehend it means the very moment you are to dook for or expect, not when you may /ook out for, Banquo. [From this note by Boswell are we to infer that he took Malone’s use of ‘look out’ as literally meaning to peep forth from the ambush wherein the murderers lay hid?—ED. ii.]— CLARENDON: If the text be right, it may bear one of two meanings: first, I will acquaint you with the most accurate observation of the time, z. ¢. with the result of the most accurate observation; or secondly, ‘the spy of the time’ may mean the man who joins the murderers in Scene iii, and ‘delivers their offices.’ But we have no examples of the use of the word ‘spy’ in the former sense, and according to the second interpretation we should rather expect ‘a@ perfect spy’ than ‘7¢he perfect spy.’ ... ‘The perfect spy’ might also be suggested, or possibly ‘the perfect’st eye,’ a bold metaphor, not alien from Shakespeare’s manner.—COLLIER (ed. ii.) : The exact moment ; but the expression has no parallel that we are aware of, and the MS Corrector puts it ‘with @ perfect spy o’ the time,’ as if Macbeth referred to some ‘perfect spy’ who was to give the two Murderers notice of the proper time. —R. G. WHITE: I have no hesitation in adopting the reading of the Collier MS Corrector. Even did not this speech bear so evidently the marks of hasty production, the use of ‘with’ for dy is common enough in our old writers to justify this construction.—[Hupson (ed. iii.): ‘The spy’ may mean person or act, it points to Ross: love of spying is the mainspring of his nature. He is the prototype of all detectives and informers. Macbeth says: ‘Within this hour at most I will advise you,’ ‘I’ll come to you anon,’ ‘I’ll call upon you straight’; how could Shakespeare tell us more plainly that Macbeth retired to consult with his confidant, and who could that confidant be but Ross?—SHERMAN: It is important to settle whether this infinitive [to Acquaint] depends upon the ‘ will’ of the line preceding, or belongs to an independent ‘ will,’ repeated or implied. I believe the latter can be supported, especially since it releases ‘acquaint’ from the restriction of ‘ within this hour.’ It seems necessary to confine this modifier to the former verb ; for, if we look ahead to the opening of Scene iii. we find that no part of the promise here made has been fulfilled till then, except what is comprised in the first ‘will’ clause.—ED. ii.]"

This was successfully accomplished by the aid of two servants whom Grevile engaged to do the deed. Fearing detection, one of the assassins afterwards murdered his comrade. The body was found, and the investigation led to the arrest and conviction of Grevile and his servant, the surviving murderer. Grevile stood mute, and was pressed to death on November 14, 1589. The circumstance must have been well known to Shakespeare, as the Greviles were at this time patrons of the living of Stratford."

        "ALLAN PARK PATON: Enter three Murtherers] (Notes and Queries 11 Sept., 13 Nov. 1869) broached and maintained the theory that the Third Murderer was Macbeth himself, and adduced in proof eight arguments. First: Although the banquet was to commence at seven, Macbeth did not go there till near midnight. Second: His entrance to the room and the appearance of the murderer are almost simultaneous. Third. So dear to his heart was the success of this plot, that during the four or five hours before the banquet he must have been taken up with the intended murder some way or other. He could not have gone to the feast with the barest chance of the plot miscarrying. Fourth—If there had been a Third Murderer sent to superintend the other two, he must have been Macbeth’s chief confidant, and as such in all probability would have been the first to announce the result. Fifth: The ‘twenty mortal murthers’ was a needless and devilish kind of mutilation, not like the work of hirelings. Sixth. The Third Murderer repeated the precise instructions given to the other two, showed unusual intimacy with the exact locality, the habits of the visitors, etc., and seems to have struck down the light, probably to escape recognition. Seventh. There was a levity in Macbeth’s manner with the murderer at the banquet, which is quite explicable if he personally knew that Banquo was dead. Eighth. When the Ghost rises, Macbeth asks those about him ‘which of them had done it,’ evidently to take suspicion off himself, and he says, in effect, to the ghost, ‘In yon black struggle you could never know me.’",
        "E. Hills: Enter three Murtherers] (Notes and Queries, 2 Oct. 1869) thus replies to Paton, whose arguments, to save space, will be referred to numerically (First): ‘I should not dwell much on this; for Shakespeare is thoroughly careless about the unities of time or place, or indeed any unity. Besides, did Macbeth not go there until midnight? I think Sc. iv. occupies several hours, but obviously it would not be convenient to break it up into three or four parts. This idea will, of course, explain [Paton’s second and third arguments]. The murder, I admit, comes before Sc. iv.; but that was necessary for the audience, and is a highly dramatic method. ... [Fourth]: I suppose the First and Second Murderers to have been retainers formerly of Banquo, in which case they would know nothing of the locality of Macbeth’s residence. So the third was a servant (and creature) of Macbeth, who went to inform them of the time of Banquo’s return, That Macbeth had plenty of such confidants is certain from [III], iv, 162-3. This supposition would also account for the First Murderer telling the tale, as it would be better for the servant to keep out of the way, whereas the First and Second Murderers would be unknown to the household. [Fifth]: Macbeth had told them “to leave no botches in the work.” Furthermore they were private enemies. [Sixth]: Here Paton seems to have written from memory. The Third Murderer neither gives nor repeats any orders at all. He simply replies “Macbeth.” [In a subsequent article Hills admits that he was ‘a little too hasty in saying that the Third Murderer “gives no orders.” He certainly “repeats no orders,” for the orders relate simply to the time and the post of action.’] ‘I do not think,’ continues Hills, ‘that the Third Murderer was the first to hear the sound of horses: for the First Murderer says: “now [sic] near approaches The object [sic] of our watch.” When did the Third Murderer identify Banquo? Did he strike out the light, who asked why it was done? Obviously the First Murderer struck it out—the man who answers “Was’t not the way?” Now why the First or Second Murderer should strike it out is plain, if the idea of their being retainers be taken; i.e. if Banquo or Fleance did escape they did not care to be recognised. And this conduct would appear strange to the Third Murderer, Macbeth’s servant. Lastly, if Macbeth was the Third Murderer, how was it that neither the First nor Second recognised him? [Seventh]: Even if there were any great levity in Macbeth’s speeches, which I myself cannot see, how far would that go in an author who has made characters reason the most quietly in the most awkward predicaments? Besides, would Shakespeare put such lines as “Then comes my fit again” [III, iv, 27] or “There the grown serpent lies” [III, iv, 37] in the mouth of a man who had been present at the murder, and who therefore knew the issue of it? [Eighth]: I think the words “Thou canst not say I did it” just the sort of words a murderer by deputy would use. To make the man actually engaged in a murder speak so, would seem to make nonsense of Shakespeare.’ This called forth a reply from PATON, in which he said, ‘The entertainment began (the hour specified must be dwelt on) at seven, and the banquet begins with the fourth scene of the third act; not far from the time when night is “almost at odds with morning.” Macbeth having just joined his guests in another part of the palace, comes with them into the hall where the banquet is prepared. Giving as his reason that it would make society the more welcome to him, he had said he would keep himself “till supper-time alone.” This is supper-time; he bids the company be seated at the table, and wishes to all appetite and health.’ To the suggestion by Hills that the Third Murderer might be a creature of Macbeth, PATON objected on the ground that Macbeth would not have been likely to entrust a share in the designed murder to such a one—a mere gatherer of gossip and political opinion. In Notes and Queries, 30 Oct. 1869, T. S. BAYNES maintains that he anticipated Paton.",
        "IRVING: Enter three Murtherers] (Nineteenth Century, April, 1877): A theory on the subject [of the Third Murderer] has struck me, which has not, so far as I am aware, been hitherto advanced. What I wish to contend is, that [the character designated as an] ‘Attendant’ is the Third Murderer. My reasons are as follows: Macbeth utters what little he does say to this attendant in a tone of marked contempt—strangely suggestive, to my mind, of his being some wretched creature entirely in Macbeth’s power. The tone of contempt [in lines 54, 58, 86, Act III, i.] is obvious, and also the fact that this attendant had been taken into his master’s confidence. The next direction is: ‘Enter Servant with two Murderers’; when Macbeth says to him, in the same tone and manner, ‘Now go to the door and stay there till we call.’ If the attendant left the chamber by one door and the murderers by another, and if Macbeth used the former egress, the suggestion would be, that at this moment, while he kept the murderers waiting, and in expectation of seeing him again (‘I’ll call upon you straight—abide within’), he went after the attendant and gave him his instructions. Macbeth thus secures to himself a check upon the two murderers in the person of this attendant, who is made an accomplice. A very slight change in the accepted stage business would make all this stratagem clear to the audience, and it fits in with my theory that the attendant was a trusty, and not a common, servant. Had he been otherwise, the most momentous and secret transaction of the play would never have been committed to him. Coming now to the murder of Banquo (III, iii.), we find that one man is a stranger to the other two—at any rate so far as his privity to the enterprise is concerned. But the manner in which the Second Murderer satisfies the First strengthens my theory. For either the Second Murderer did not recognise the stranger at all, owing to the darkness of the night, or else perhaps they did not recognise him as the attendant whom they had seen before; in which case also they would have been chary of confiding in him. Indeed, the instant reply of the Second Murderer would favour the assumption that the stranger was a man they already knew, and the exact familiarity which the Third Murderer shows with the surroundings of the palace and the readiness with which his information is accepted by the others, suggest that he must have been somebody quite conversant with the palace usages and approaches. My theory would account for this familiar acquaintance on the part of the Third Murderer without recourse to any such violent improbability as that the Third Murderer was Macbeth himself. Think of the effect of the First Murderer being brought to the banquet room by the attendant, and the latter standing by during the ghastly recital of the murder. If this expedient were adopted, there would be no intrinsic absurdity in the appearance of the strange man at the feast. He might come there with a secrecy the more effectual because of its apparent openness, for he would be in the company of one of Macbeth’s chief retainers. The conversation so conducted, only just out of earshot of the whole company, might be no violation of probability, even though the deadliest secret were clothed under the natural disguise. But the effect upon the audience would be widely different from that of the present almost unmanageable tradition, which necessitates an improbability so absurd as to render almost ridiculous what might be one of the most thrilling horrors of the tragedy.",
        "Hudson: Enter three Murtherers] (ed. iii.) I am by no means sure but [Paton] is right.... Perhaps the strongest point against this view is, that Macbeth seems surprised, and goes into a rapture, on being told that ‘Fleance is 'scaped’; but this may not be very much; he may there be feigning. On the other hand, Macbeth’s actual sharing in the deed of murder would go far to account for his terrible hallucination at the banquet.",
        "Moy Thomas: Enter three Murtherers] (Atheneum, 14 Ap. 1877) shows that the stage- directions whereon Irving lays stress are not to be found in the Folio; and concludes that: ‘If [the Third Murderer and the Attendant] were the same person they would almost necessarily have been represented by the same actor. On this supposition, however, it is obvious that the stage-directions are singularly deficient, and are certainly likely to cause confusion in the prompter’s box. To the argument that the Third Murderer evidently knew “all the surroundings of the palace” and, therefore, was likely to be the attendant previously introduced, it is enough to answer that, whoever he was, he must have been in close connection with Macbeth.’",
        "Lissy: Enter three Murtherers] (see note on I, ii, 53): If Ross is the Third Murderer, as we hope to establish, then it is clear that it is because Shakespeare is dealing with the spy- system that he refuses to give up the name of this villain. It should be remembered that Shakespeare does not merely neglect to name the Third Murderer, he emphasizes the mystery in every possible way to arouse our curiosity, once more masking the business for weighty reasons. [Lissy here quotes Paton's eight arguments in proof that Macbeth is the Third Murderer.] In replying to these arguments it may be said generally that most of them apply well to Macbeth, but better to Ross. More particularly they are met as follows: (1) Macbeth went to the banquet as soon as Ross had returned by a short way and reported. (2) The murderer (who certainly did not know the short way home) reached Macbeth about twenty minutes later than Ross. (3) Macbeth had passed a terrible time of inactivity before Ross returned, and that unhinged his mind: he is more unhinged by that horrible imagining than he had been by the murder of Duncan. (4) Ross was Macbeth’s chief confidant at this time, and was the first to announce the result. (5) The twenty mortal murthers was extremely characteristic of that poltroon Ross, panic-stricken and stabbing in the dark a rival who had recognised him. (6) Ross knew the place and the guests as only such a spy could know them: he struck down after the terrible recognition of Banquo’s ‘O, Slave,’ which applies infinitely better to this spy than to Macbeth. Ross owed his power to his service of Macbeth. If Macbeth might have been recognised by Banquo, as Paton says, why was he not recognised by the murderers? (7) Macbeth was amused by the comparison of the account of the murderer with that of Ross. The fact that he had the news accounts for his levity. Ross had given Macbeth hopes that the murderers might have pursued Fleance, and the only point Macbeth really wants information about is the death or escape of Fleance. (8) When the ghost arises Macbeth asks those about him ‘which of them’ had done it, because he suspects his colleague in crime. On returning to the room he sees the man whom Ross and the Murderer at the door had sworn to be dead; he suspects his colleague naturally. Ross endeavors to mislead the other nobles at the banquet and to defend Macbeth. When Paton says that Macbeth says in effect to the ghost ‘In yon black struggle you could never know me,’ he probably alludes to the speech of Macbeth: ‘Thou canst not say I did it,’ which means that he was not present at the murder.",
        "DEIGHTON: Enter three Murtherers] refers to Paton’s and Bayne’s theory in regard to the Third Murderer being Macbeth, but thinks that ‘the anxiety shown by Macbeth in the next scene seems far too real to be mere acting.’ —ED. ii."

At least it is not said dialogue-wise with the lady, who knew nothing of his intentions respecting Banquo.—[Wilson: Worth. [... These lines] are her only waking acknowledgments of having mistaken life! So—they forbode the Sleep-Walking, and the Death—as an owl, or a raven, or vulture, or any fowl of obscene wing, might flit between the sun and a crowned but doomed head—the shadow but of a moment, yet ominous for the augur, of an entire fatal catastrophe.—ED. ii.]"

And very properly; for there—where noble poets represent the world's history upon the ‘boards that imitate the world,’ there—no brutes should be allowed. But in the present scene it is hard to avoid introducing a horse, and the Poet has to obviate the difficulty in four almost insignificant lines, in order to account for the absence of the steeds. It is, after all, undoubtedly better not to shrink from two or three such trivial lines than to have a horse come clattering on the stage.

        "JOHNSON: thee without] ‘I am more pleased that the blood of Banquo should be on thy face than in his body.’ Shakespeare might mean: ‘It is better that Banquo’s blood were on thy face than he in this room.’—HUNTER: Anything, almost, is to be preferred to the common explanation that Macbeth addresses this sentence to the Murderer. I would submit as the Poet’s intention, that Macbeth goes to the door, and there sees the Murderer with the evidence of the crime upon him: and with that infirmity of purpose which belongs to him, that occasional rising of the milk of human kindness, he is deeply shocked at the sight, especially contrasting it with the gaiety of the banquet; he retires from the door, meditates, and then, feeling the importance to him of having got quit of Banquo, he utters the expression aside, ‘Tis better thee without than he within’: that, horrible as it is, thus in the midst of the feast, to behold the assassin of his friend just without the door, it is still better than that Banquo himself should be alive and within the hall a guest at this entertainment. He thus recovers himself, and then goes to the door again to ask if the deed had been done effectually, ‘Is he dispatch’d?’ In what follows, we cannot suppose that Macbeth speaks so as to be heard by the Murderer, much less speaks to him, revealing the secret purpose and thoughts of his mind. They are aside speeches.—CLARENDON : It is better outside thee than inside him. In spite of the defective grammar, this must be the meaning, or there would be no point in the antithesis.

        "scorch’d] Theobald (Sh. Restored, p. 185): Shakespeare, I am very well persuaded, had this notion in his head (how true, in fact, I will not pretend to determine), that if you cut a serpent, or worm, asunder, there is such an unctious quality in their blood that the dismembered parts, being placed near enough to touch each other, will cement and become whole again. Macbeth considers Duncan’s sons so much as members of their Father that though he has cut off the old man, he has not entirely killed him, but he’ll cement and close again in the lives of his sons. Shakespeare certainly wrote scotch’d. To scotch, however the Generality of our Dictionaries happen to omit the word, signifies to notch, slash, hack, cut, with Twigs, Swords, etc., and so our Poet more than once has used it in his works. See Coriol, IV, v, 198.—Upton (p. 170): This learned and elegant allusion is to the story of the Hydra—Harry Rowe: My Prompter, who is a North-Country man, says that there is no such word as scotch’d. It is scutch’d, a word chiefly used by the growers and manufacturers of hemp and flax, and implies beating, bruising, or dividing. The wooden-headed fellow of my company, who plays the clown, says that snakes are soon killed by lashing them with switches, and that by smart strokes their bodies may be divided. This has induced some of the gentlemen of my green-room to adopt ‘We have switch’d the snake,’ etc. The stuffed figure of my company, who plays the Serpent in The History of Adam and Eve, has suggested a reading that is more conformable to natural history: ‘We have bruzsed the snake. . . She’ll coz/” etc. My Prompter wishes the original text to be continued, only substituting coz/ for ‘close,’ and this he calls a good emendation. I have accordingly adopted it. After all, I do not consider Shakespeare as under any obligations to his scotching, scutching, bruising, and switching commentators.—Clarendon: ‘Scorch’d is said to be derived from the French escorcher, to strip off the bark or skin. From the next line it is clear that we want a word with a stronger sense here.—[Skeat (Notes, etc.): In Com. of Err. V, i, 183, we are told that one of the twin brothers, being greatly enraged against his wife, threatens ‘to scorch [her] face and to disfigure’ [her]. Schmidt enters this under the ordinary verb to scorch, but Gollancz explains it by ‘excoriate,’ which is nearer the mark. The right sense is given in Stratmann, where we find this entry: ‘scorchen, vb., from scoren, [to] score, cut, Babees Book, p. 80.’ The quotation in the Babees Book is: ‘ With . . . knyfe scortche not the boorde,’ i.e. do not score the table with your knife. The derivation from score is not wholly satisfactory, as it does not account for the final ch. I think it is clear that we have here an example of what is really fairly common in English—formed as it is by a fusion of Romance with Teutonic—viz. the evolution of a new word which has resulted from the confusion of two others. The ordinary verb scorch, tho’ it usually means ‘to parch,’ meant originally to excoriate, or rather, to excorticate; it is derived from the Old French escorcher, to strip off bark, from a Latin type excorticare. By confusion of this with the word score, a new verb, scorch, was formed, with the sense of to make an incision on the surface only, to cut with shadow incisions, to scratch with a knife. And this it is which Antipholus of Ephesus threatened to do. He did not want to excoriate or flay his wife’s face, but merely to scratch it so as to spoil her beauty. We can now proceed a step further; for this new verb, to scorch, being really distinct from the original one, was frequently subjected to a more rapid pronunciation, and is better known under the form to scotch, which has precisely the same sense. This is well seen by help of the famous passage in Macbeth, III, ii, 13, ‘we have scotched the snake, not killed it,’ which is really a ‘correction’ made by Theobald; for, as a matter of fact, the reading in the Ff is ‘scorch’d.’ That is to say, the Ff are perfectly correct, as is not unfrequently the case, and the editorial ‘correction’ was needless. The sense is, we have scored or scratched the snake, we have wounded him upon the surface only. The ordinary sense of scorch will not help us here. The shortening to scotch is proved, however, by two considerations: (1) the passage in Coriol. IV, v, 198, ‘he scotched [him] and notched him like a carbonado,’ where the riming of the words is evidently intentional, whilst at the same time these words are nearly equivalent in sense; and (2) by the compound word hop- scotch, which means a game in which children hop over scotches or slight scores upon the ground, as it is correctly explained in the New English Dictionary.—ED. ii.] 22-25.

In the very contemplation of the murder of Banquo, Macbeth is vainly seeking for peace. Banquo is the object that makes him eat his meal in fear and sleep in terrible dreams. His death, therefore, is determined, and then comes the fearful lesson, ‘Better be with,’ etc. There is no peace with the wicked.—Elwin: The alteration of F, destroys the force of the original antithesis, as the dead have not place.—Dyce (ed. i.): The lection of F, is not to be hastily discarded, when we consider what a fondness Shakespeare has for the repetition of words.—Keightley (p. 64): The first ‘peace’ was probably suggested, in the usual manner, by the second. We might read seat or some such word. There is one most remarkable case of substitution to which sufficient attention has never been given by the critics. It may be termed reaction or repetition, and arises from the impression made by some particular word on the mind of the transcriber or printer, or even of the writer himself.—Clarendon: There is no necessity to make any change. For the first ‘peace’ compare III, i, 59, 60: ‘To be thus is nothing; But to be safely thus’; and for the second, IV, iii, 207, and note.—Hudson: Peace is nowise that which Macbeth has been seeking; his end was simply to gain the throne, the place which he now holds, the fear of losing which is the very thing which keeps peace from him.—Singer (ed. ii.): Shakespeare would hardly have written ‘to gain our peace.’ Macbeth gained his place by the murder of Duncan, but certainly did not obtain ‘peace,’ in any sense of the word.—LettSom (ap. Dyce, ed. ii.): The possessive pronoun ‘our’ is fatal to the reading of F1. . . . The editor of F1 could not have been offended by a quibble, for he must have been ‘to the manner born.’ He, no doubt, felt that the notion of obtaining peace by murdering a king was absurd, and could never have entered into the head of a public man.—Dyce (ed. ii.): Compare what Lady Macbeth has previously said, I, v, 78.",

Thus Merry Wives, IV, vi, 51; Mid. N, D.V, i, 55; Jul. Cas. I, i, 70, and Hen. II, ii, 13.— WALKER (Crit. ii, 73): It appears that ceremony and ceremonious were pronounced by our ancient poets,—very frequently at least,—cer’mony and cer’monous. We should therefore perhaps arrange this line: ‘From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony ; meeting’ in order to avoid [Vers. p. 272] the trisyllabic termination of the next line [‘remembrancer’], which is so frequent in the dramatists of a later age, but which occurs very seldom indeed in Shakespeare.—LETTSOM (foot-note to preceding Crit. ii, 73]: Some of the writers quoted by Walker seem to have even pronounced cermny, cermnous."

It is only through a misapprehension, which unjustly lowers the generosity of her character and unduly exalts that of her husband, that so many critics have represented this passage (‘Be innocent of the knowledge,’ etc.) as spoken by Macbeth out of a magnanimous desire to spare his wife all guilty participation in an act which at the same time, they tell us, he believes will give her satisfaction.

Such another description of the beetle occurs in Chapman’s Eugenia, 1614: ‘The beetle... with his Anvil-like humming gave the dor Of death to men,’ [Vigiliz Tertiee Inductio.—ED. ii.].—Tollett: The ‘shard-born beetle’ is the beetle born in dung. Aristotle and Pliny mention beetles that breed in dung. Poets as well as natural historians have made the same observation. See Drayton’s Ideas, 31: ‘I scorn all earthly dung-bred scarabies.’ So, Jonson, [ed. Gifford, vol. i, p. 61]: ‘But men of thy condition feed on sloth, As doth the beetle on the dung she breeds in.’ That shard signifies dung is well known in the North of Staffordshire, where cowshard is the word generally used for cow- dung.—Patterson (p. 65): The beetle’s wings are protected from external injury by two very hard, horny wing-cases, or elytra.... These shards or wing-cases are raised and expanded when the beetle flies, and by their concavity act like two parachutes in supporting him in the air. Hence ‘the shard-borne beetle,’ a description embodied in a single epithet— Clarendon: ‘Shard’ is derived from the Anglo-Saxon sceard, a fragment, generally of pottery. ... Tollet’s reading is unquestionably wrong, though ‘shard’ means ‘dung’ in some dialects."

Of all the deeply tragic passages of this drama, this is the deepest. Unintentionally and unconsciously there here breathes from Macbeth’s soul an echo of that happier time when the mutual esteem of a heroic pair was accompanied by the delicate attentions of first love. ... Ambition has caused their love for each other to cool, until we see them united solely by a fiendish alliance in pursuit of an ambitious end,—so here this love, grown cold, was murdered in the murder of the King, and the tenderness in this scene is naught but a dirge, rising unconsciously from the soul, over the sentiments of an earlier time, [p. 468, ed. 1873.—ED. ii.]. 56-66, Come, seeling Night... with me] Beljame, whose translation of Macbeth was crowned by the French Academy, thus renders this passage: ‘Viens, nuit qui silles les paupiéres, Bande les tendres yeux du jour pitoyable, Et de ta main sanglante et invisible Annule et déchire en morceaux ce grave contrat Qui fait mon visage pale!—La lumiére s’épaissit, et la corneille Gagne a tire-d’aile le bois hanté des freux; Les honnétes créatures du jour commencent a languir et à s’assoupir, Pendant que les noirs agents de la nuit s’éveillent pour leur proie.

To the last, however, one thin hand’s-breadth of melancholy light remains—the sadness of the day without its strength. Macbeth is the prey of a profound world-weariness. And while a huge ennui pursues crime, the criminal is not yet in utter blackness of night. When the play opens the sun is already dropping below the verge. And at sunset strange winds arise, and gather the clouds to westward with mysterious pause and stir, so the play of Macbeth opens with movement of mysterious, spiritual powers, which are auxiliary of that awful shadow which first creeps, and then strides, across the moral horizon.—ED. ii."

        "Rookie] Roperick (Edwards, p. 274, 1765): I should imagine Shakespeare intended to give us the idea of the gloominess of the woods at the close of the evening; and wrote: ‘to th’ murky (or dusky) wood’: words used by him on other like occasions, and not very remote from the traces of that in the text.—Steevens: This may mean damp, misty, steaming with exhalations. It is only a North-Country variation of dialect from veeky. In Coriol. III, iii, 121, we have ‘the reek o’ the rotten fens.’ ‘Rooky wood,’ indeed, may signify a rookery, the wood that abounds with rooks; yet merely to say of the crow that he is flying to a wood inhabited by rooks, is to add little immediately pertinent to the succeeding observation, viz.: that ‘— things of day begin to droop and drowse.’ I cannot, therefore, help supposing our author wrote: ‘makes wing to rook i’ th’ wood.’ That is, to roost in it—Harry Rowe: A rooky wood is simply a wood where there are rookeries, and has nothing to do with the ‘reek of rotten fens.’.—Footby: That is, foggy. Any East Anglian plough-boy would have instantly removed the learned commentator’s doubt whether it had anything to do with rooks. [The same meaning is given in Carr’s Craven Dialect, 1828; Brockett’s North Country Words, 1829, and in Morris’s Glossary of Furness, 1869. The last adds: ‘Icel. rakr. ‘‘Roky, or misty, nebulosus.’’—Promp, Parv.—ED.]—Mitford (Gent. Maga. Aug. 1844, p. 129): ‘Crow’ is the common appellation of the ‘rook,’ the latter word being used only when we would speak with precision, and never by the country people, as the word ‘crow-keeper’ will serve to show, which means the boy who keeps the rooks (not carrion crows) off the seed-corn. The carrion crow, which is the crow proper, being almost extinct, the necessity of distinguishing it from the rook has passed away in common usage. The passage, therefore, simply means, ‘the rook hastens its evening flight to the wood where its fellows are already assembled,’ and to our mind ‘the rooky wood’ is a lively and natural picture: the generic term ‘crow’ is used for the specific ‘rook.’"

This was successfully accomplished by the aid of two servants whom Grevile engaged to do the deed. Fearing detection, one of the assassins afterwards murdered his comrade. The body was found, and the investigation led to the arrest and conviction of Grevile and his servant, the surviving murderer. Grevile stood mute, and was pressed to death on November 14, 1589.

But an anonymous critic pointed out to him that Macbeth was not a coward ; and with that good sense and modesty which always distinguished him, he adopted the advice. It is curious to think that even twenty years later, another anonymous critic wrote to him, to object to this amended view, and said that Macbeth should show signs of terror. But Garrick recollected his old critic’s argument, and reproduced it in answer to his new one. ‘My notion, he says, ‘as well as execution, of the line are, I fear, opposite to your opinion, Should Macbeth sink into pusillanimity, I imagine that it would hurt the character, and be contrary to the opinions of Shakespeare. The first appearance of the spirit overcomes him more than the second ; but even before it vanishes at first, Macbeth gains strength—‘If thou canst nod, speak too,’ must be spoke with horror, but with a recovering mind; and in the next speech with him he cannot pronounce ‘‘Avaunt and quit my sight!’’ without a stronger exertion of his powers.

At a slight touch of the innocent, such a stone moved, but ‘the secret man of blood’ found that his best strength could not stir it.

Is it not likely, therefore, that Scot and not Virgil suggested the speaking trees? Scot may have been indebted to Virgil for his statement in regard to the trees at the death of Caesar. In the Georgics, i, 476, speaking of the portents before that event, Virgil says: ‘Vox quoque per lucos vulgé exaudita silentes Ingens.’—ED. ii.]"

The reference to ‘trading and trafficking’ seem to imply a bargain between Macbeth and the witches, but there has been no mention of such. What were the ‘gains’ in which they were all to share? ‘Macbeth has offered the witches no bribe, nor have they intimated that they desire or expect any. Besides, Hecate has no reason to find fault with what they have done. She could not have managed the affair better. How, so far as the Witches are concerned, has Macbeth proved a “wayward son, spiteful and wrathful”?...I may remind the reader that the managers of Shakespeare’s day were much given to these sensational additions to Shakespeare’s plays. The Hymen of As You Like It and the vision in Cymb. are clear instances of the kind.’—For a further discussion bearing somewhat on these questions, see IV, i, 41."

        "Malone: Who cannot want] The sense requires Who can. Yet I believe the text is not corrupt. Shakespeare is sometimes incorrect in these minutiae.—[Becket: Who cannot want] (note in Lear, i, 152): ‘The immediately preceding hemistich, “Men must not walk too late,” now printed with a full stop at “late,” should there have a comma. “Men must not walk too late at night, who cannot want the thought”—i.e. “Men must not walk when darkness covers the earth, who cannot be wanting in thought, or who cannot hide their thoughts.” The inference to be drawn from which is, that they who should not so pretend or counterfeit, would be in danger from Macbeth.’—That this note occurs in Lear probably accounts for its omission by subsequent commentators on Macbeth. It was pointed out by J. Crosby in a private note, and anticipates R. G. White’s suggestion in his Shakespeare Scholar (p. 403), which Moberly adopted in his text, and occasioned Lettsom’s marginal MS comment ‘Good!’ in a copy of White’s volume. White’s note is, nevertheless, here reproduced for the sake of Dyce’s comment thereon.—ED. ii.",
        "Elwin: Who cannot want] To want is here used to signify needful, compulsory desire. The sentence expresses, Who cannot desire, as a strong necessity of his nature, to think such a crime monstrous.",
        "R.G. White: Who cannot want] (Shakespeare Scholar, etc., p. 403): May we not remove the point after the last ‘late’ [line 10] and read thus, making the passage declarative instead of interrogative?—men must not walk too late Who cannot want the, etc. That is, ‘men, who will think that the alleged murder of Duncan by his sons is a crime too monstrous for belief, must be careful not to walk too late.—Dyce: My kind friend, Mr Grant White, must allow me to say that I think his change of the punctuation in this passage quite wrong, and his explanation over-subtle: surely, Macbeth’s chief reason for getting rid of Banquo was, not ‘because Banquo more than suspected who was the real perpetrator of the crime,’ but because the Witches had declared that Banquo was to be “father to a line of kings”; hence Macbeth’s injunction to the Murderers, III, i, 163. [Compare Holinshed in Appendix,]—Collier (ed. ii): Who cannot but think.",
        "R.G. White: Who cannot want] A careful consideration of this passage, and a recollection of the mistakes that I have made myself and known others to make, have led me unwillingly to the belief that Malone may have been right in his opinion that, although the sense requires ‘Who can want the thought,’ the text is as Shakespeare wrote it, and that the disagreement between the words and the thought is due to a confusion of thought which Shakespeare may have sometimes shared with inferior intellects.",
        "Keightley: Who cannot want] This passage as it stands is evident nonsense, which Shakespeare never wrote, and if we read We for ‘Who,’ we have the very word he wrote, and most excellent sense.",
        "Delius: Who cannot want] As Shakespeare sometimes, in order to express a simple negative, multiplies the negatives not, nor, never, etc., so, on the other hand, he sometimes adds them, as in this case, to negative verbs or particles, without altering the sense. Thus in Winter’s Tale, III, ii, 55, ‘That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence,’ and in Cymb. I, iv, 23, ‘a beggar without less quality,’ the negative ‘less’ merely strengthens the negative already included in ‘wanted’ and ‘without.’",
        "Dalgleish: Who cannot want] The affirmative interrogation is equal to the negative response, “No one can want,” etc. See I, v, 30.",
        "Clarendon: Who cannot want] This construction arises from a confusion of thought common enough when a negative is expressed or implied, and is so frequent in Greek as to be almost sanctioned by usage. Compare e.g. Herodotus, iv, 118: γὰρ γὰρ ὃ Τέριον οὐδὲν τε μᾶλλον ἔχει μιᾶς ἢ οὐ καὶ ἔχει τινᾶς, and Thucydides, iii, 36, ἁμαρτάνουσι δὲ οὐ μόνον ἅπαντες ἀλλά τινες τῶν αἰτίων. It would be easy to find instances in all English writers of Shakespeare’s time. Take the following from his own works, Winter’s Tale, I, ii, 260; King Lear, II, iv, 140: ‘I have hope You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty.’",
        "Baynes: Who cannot want] (p. 275): The passage as it stands is perfectly good sense, and perfectly good English of Shakespeare’s day, as it still remains perfectly good Northern English or Lowland Scotch of our own day. In these dialects the verb ‘want,’ especially when construed with negative particles, has precisely the meaning which the critics insist the sense requires. If a farmer in the North of England, or the Scotch Lowlands, send to borrow a neighbor’s horse, and receives a negative reply, it would probably be conveyed in some such form as, ‘He says he cannot want the horse to-day,’ i.e. he cannot do without the horse; he must have the horse for his own use. In the same way, if an Edinburgh porter say to his comrade, ‘I'll no want a gill of whiskey the morn,’ he would express in a strong form his determination to have one. This use of the verb was not uncommon amongst English writers in Shakespeare’s day. Thus, in The Country Farm, translated from the French, 1600, we have, ‘Ploughing, an art that a householder cannot want.’ And Markham, speaking of the herb purslane, says, ‘—a ground once possessed by them will seldom want them.’ Many words and phrases, now peculiar to the Scotch Lowlands, were common to both countries in Shakespeare’s day, and every one of the so-called Scotticisms to be found in his dramas is used by contemporary English writers. As a mere English writer, therefore, Shakespeare was entitled to use this verb in what is now its Northern signification, and he appears to have done so elsewhere. It might, however, then as now, be characteristic of the North, where alone it has survived, and would thus naturally find a place in Macbeth, which contains other Scotticisms, such as loov, for example.",
        "Hudson: Who cannot want] (ed. iii, p. 197): The reading who can now, proposed by Cartwright, occurred to me independently.—ED. ii.",

The King himself had told the Queen that same night that he had not sent to Macduff—but that he had heard ‘by the way’ that he was not coming to the banquet—and he only learns of the flight of Macduff after the Cauldron Scene [IV, i, 169]. For an Usurper and a Tyrant, his Majesty is singularly ill-informed about the movements of his most dangerous Thanes! But Lenox, I think, must have been not a little surprised at that moment [IV, i, 169] to find that so far from the exasperated Tyrant having ‘prepared for some attempt of war’ with England—he had not till then positively known that Macduff had fled!...The whole dialogue between Lenox and the Lord is miraculous.

He suggests, as an explanation of its present position, that it ‘was shifted when III, v. was inserted, in order to prevent the two witch scenes from coming together, a necessary precaution when there were no changes of scene and no intervals between the scenes.’ If this transposition of scenes, which occurred to me independently, be adopted, how can we reconcile the fact that it is Lenox who, at the end of IV, i, informs Macbeth of Macduff’s flight to England?—ED. ii."

On the other hand, lines of eight or nine syllables, as they are at variance with the general rhythm of his poetry (at least, if my ears do not deceive me, this is the case), so they scarcely ever occur in his plays,—it were hardly too much to say, not at all.... With regard to the other, or legitimate short lines, I am inclined to think that sometimes, though very rarely, two lines of this sort occur consecutively in Shakespeare, for there are passages which cannot be otherwise arranged without destroying the harmony, as seems to me. So arrange, ‘Under a yoke [sic] accurst! [one line]. Lord. Vl send my prayérs with him.’ [another line]. A conclusion of a scene quite in Shakespeare’s manner,"

        "Knowles: Enter the three Witches] Macready suggested the following arrangement of this scene: Let the Witches be placed in different parts of the cavern. Suppose one at the mouth, intently on the watch; another near the cauldron, cowering over the livid flame, ... The Third Witch on the side opposite the entrance, seated perhaps upon a fragment of stone ... Let not a word be spoken, till the audience have had time to study the picture ... [ The familiars ... are supposed to be stationed outside the cavern to give notice of the approach of Hecate ... The First Witch hears her familiar ... The eyes ... turned ... a pause ... The Witch near the cauldron hears her familiar; ... Another pause ...] The Third Witch springs upon her feet ... [The familiars do not, however, give notice of the approach of Hecate, ... but show when the conditions are favourable for the beginning of the charm.—ED. ii.]—Fleay (Sh. Manual, p. 250): What are the witches of this scene? ... I hold the latter view ... The witches in IV, i, are just like Middleton's witches, only superior in quality ... they have not the prophetic knowledge of the weird sisters ... their knowledge is from the pricking of their thumbs; they are submissive to the great King who calls them filthy hags, secret, black, and midnight hags ... ambiguous, delusive: those of the weird sisters were pithy, inevitable ...",

        "Warburton: Cat] A cat, from time immemorial, has been the agent and favourite of witches. ... This superstitious fancy originated perhaps thus: When Galinthia was changed into a cat by the Fates ... Hecate took pity ... and made her her priestess. Hecate, herself too ... assumed the shape of a cat.—Johnson: A witch, who was tried ... before the time of Shakespeare, had a cat named Rutterkin, as the spirit of one of these witches was Grimalkin.—Douce: We know that the Egyptians typified the moon by this animal. Some of the ancients have supposed that the cat became fat or lean with the increase or wane of the moon ... Even after the Dark Ages had grown light, ... The stories told of her impish wickedness have the same general character throughout Europe ... Again and again she figures with direful prominence in the records of demonology ... a black-hearted Scottish witch confessed in ... 1591 ... she and other witches had carried this animal \"sayling in their Riddles or Cives into the middest of the sea, and so left it before the towne of Leith; whereupon there did arise such a tempest at sea, as a greater hath not been seen...\" ... —ED. ii."

      "play": "LADY MACDUFF: What had he done, to make him fly the land?",
      "notes": [
        "Fletcher: Scena Secunda] It mars the whole spirit and moral of the play, to take anything from that depth and liveliness of interest which the dramatist has attached to the characters and fortunes of Macduff and his Lady. They are the chief representatives in the piece, of the interests of loyalty and domestic affection, as opposed to those of the foulest treachery and the most selfish and remorseless ambition... . It is not enough that we should hear the story in the brief words in which it is related to Macduff by his fugitive cousin, Ross. The presence of the affectionate family before our eyes,—the timid lady’s eloquent complaining to her cousin, of her husband's deserting them in danger,—the graceful prattle with her boy, in which she seeks relief from her melancholy forebodings,—and then the sudden entrance of Macbeth’s murderous ruffians,—are all requisite to give that crowning horror, that consummately and violently revolting character to Macbeth’s career, which Shakespeare has so evidently studied to impress upon it. Nothing has more contributed to favor the false notion of a certain sympathy which the dramatist has been supposed to have excited for the character and fate of this most gratuitously criminal of his heroes, than the theatrical narrowing of the space, and consequent weakening of the interest, which his unerring judgement has assigned in the piece to those representatives of virtue and humanity, for whom he has really sought to move the sympathies of his audience. It is no fault of his if Macbeth’s heartless whinings have ever extracted one emotion of pity from reader or auditor, in lieu of that intensely aggravated abhorrence which they ought to inspire.",
        "Coleridge: Scena Secunda] This scene, dreadful as it is, is still a relief, because a variety, because domestic, and therefore soothing, as associated with the only real pleasures of life. The conversation between Lady Macduff and her child heightens the pathos, and is preparatory for the deep tragedy of their assassination.... To the objection that Shakespeare wounds the moral sense by the unsubdued, undisguised description of the most hateful atrocity,—that he tears the feelings without mercy, and even outrages the eye itself with scenes of insupportable horror,—I, omitting Titus Andronicus as not genuine, and excepting the scene of Gloster’s blinding in King Lear, answer boldly in the name of Shakespeare, not guilty !",
        "Bodenstedt: Scena Secunda] To omit this scene, as is usually the case on the stage, is to present Macbeth’s character in a far more favorable light than Shakespeare intended, and to weaken the force of Macduff’s cry of agony, and Lady Macbeth’s heart-piercing question in the sleep-walking scene. We must be made to see how far Macbeth’s unavailing bloodthirstiness reaches, which spares not even innocent women and children. Moreover, in this tragedy of hypocritical treachery and faithless ambition, Macduff and his wife are the exponents of honest loyalty and domestic virtue.",
        "Clarendon: Scena Secunda] The scene of the murder of Lady Macduff and her children is traditionally placed at Dunne-marle Castle, Culross, Perthshire.",
        "Leighton: Scena Secunda] The purpose of this scene seems simply to illustrate, by presenting absolutely before our eyes a massacre of innocents, the devilish wickedness of Macbeth. If it were necessary to do this, we would expect of the genius of Shakespeare in this play, where that genius is so-~powerfully illustrated, that the scene should be made to serve at the same time some purpose of contrast or characterization, and the lack of any such secondary purpose lends its weight to heighten suspicion against genuineness of authorship. Its repulsive character has no excuse of necessity ; hence, zesthetically, it has no right to be. The tragedy is more perfect and symmetrical without it. It points no lesson, develops no character, explains no necessary action; but retards the movement, and shocks us with its accumulation of murders, of which we already have had a surfeit. In the misfortune of the presumably innocent mother and child, it makes more striking another instance of inexplicable ethical injustice.",
        "Libby: Scena Secunda] Ross came as Macbeth’s spy to lead a gang of assassins: during his interview with the lady the murderers await him outside, and within three minutes of his exit they enter, within four minutes the poor little fellow is dead, and within five minutes the lady is butchered. Where is the sword of Ross, who has just said, ‘Shall not be long but I’ll be here again’? .. . Unless Ross can be cleared of the charge of allowing the Macduffs to be murdered before he had left the castle (there is much to show that he directed the assassins) his character is worse than his master’s."

The last foot contains, instead of one extra syllable, two extra syllables, one of which is slurred. [A term phonetically unintelligible to me.— EL.is; Zarly Eng. Pronunciation, Part iii, p. 944.] (§ 496): In other cases the appearance of an Alexandrine arises from the non-observance of contractions : ‘I dre | abide | no lénger | Whither should Poe fly? So in V, iii, 7: ‘All mért | al césse | guence(s) have | pronéunced | me thus.’ —ELLIs: These ‘contractions’ would have a remarkably harsh effect in the instances cited, even if they were possible. No person accustomed to write verses could well endure lines thus divided [as above. In the present instance] the line belongs to two speeches and ‘should’ may be emphatic. ...

To enlist our sympathies to the fullest extent, and to make the moral of the play most effective, the spirit of ill, represented by Macbeth, should be opposed by a spotless champion of good and right, and not by one suffering in reputation under such accusations as his wife makes against the fugitive Thane."

This is a strong picture of obstinate resolution. So, Falstaff says to Hal: ‘If thou see me down in the battle, and destride me, so.’ —1 Hen. IV: V,i, 121. Birthdom for birthright is formed by the same analogy with masterdom in this play, signifying the przvzleges or rights of a master. Perhaps it might be dzr¢hdame for mother; let us stand over our mother that lies bleeding on the ground.—CLARENDON: ‘Birthdom’ is formed on the analogy of ‘kingdom,’ ‘earldom,’ ‘masterdom,’ I, v, 68, with this difference, that ‘king,’ ‘earl,’ ‘master,’ designate persons, and ‘birth’ a condition; the termination ‘-dom’ is connected with ‘doom,’ and ‘kingdom’ signifies the extent of a king’s jurisdiction. It loses its original force when joined to adjectives, as in ‘freedom,’ ‘wisdom,’ etc., and is then equivalent to the German - Aeit, in Weisheit, Fretheit, our ‘-hood.’ ‘Birthdom’ here does not, as we think, signify ‘birthright,’ but ‘the land of our birth,’ now struck down and prostrate beneath the usurper’s feet."

        "THEOBALD: stickes] I should think s¢rzkes deeper; a tree, or plant, is said by gardeners to strzke, when it shoots its fibres out deep into the earth, and begins to feel its root.— HEATH (p. 404): ‘Summer-seeming’ gives a very apt and proper sense; that is, Which hath no other inconvenience than that of an extraordinary heat for the time, such as we commonly experience in summer, and which is of no long duration. However, as the integrity of the metaphor, which is taken from the growth of a plant, and particularly the root of it, is not well preserved, I am inclined to believe Shakespeare wrote, ‘summer- seeding,’ i.e. Than lust, which, like a summer plant, runs up to seed during that season, and quickly afterwards dies away.—[STEEVENS in 1785 quoted Blackstone as the author of this conjecture, swmmer-seeding, although Heath anticipated the latter by twenty years. Attention was called to Heath’s claims in the Anonymous Variorum edition of 1807; but with this exception, and that of the Cambridge Editors, every editor who has noticed the conjecture has accorded it to Blackstone. I have been unable to find where STEEVENS obtained this note of the eminent Justice: it is not in the list published by the Shakespeare Society in vol, xii. of their Papers. —Ep.]—JOHNSON: When I was younger and bolder I corrected it thus: ‘Than fume, or seething lust,’ z. e. angry passion of boiling lust.— STEEVENS: Lust that seems as hot as swmmer.—MALONE: In Donne’s poems [Love's Alchemy,— CLARENDON] we meet with ‘winter-seeming.’—HuDSON: The passion that burns awhile like summer, and like summer passes away; whereas the other passion, avarice, has no such date, but grows stronger and stronger to the end of life.—STAUNTON: We are unwilling to disturb the old text, though we have a strong persuasion that Shakespeare wrote ‘summer-seaming lust,’ 2. e. lust fa¢tened by summer heat.— CLARENDON: Befitting, or looking like, summer. Avarice is compared to a plant which strikes its roots deep and lasts through every season; lust to an annual which flourishes in summer and then dies. ALLEN (MS): We should (I think) write thus: This avarice Sticks deeper—grows with more pernicious root—Than summer-’ seeming lust. Shakespeare conceives of avarice (‘the good old-gentlemanly vice’ of Byron) as a plant of Autumn and Winter, deeper rooted, more lasting; of Lust, as a plant of Summer, earlier and more rapid in its growth, but less enduring. Lust is, therefore, a vice that naturally goes with (and in so far beseems) Youth, the Summer of life. ‘Seeming,’ then, is but beseeming, with its prefix dropt, as in rapid or familiar conversation. Shakespeare so wrote elsewhere. It may be added that the idea crops out, in another form, a few lines below, in ‘the king-becoming’ graces."

According to Holinshed, p. 244, col. 1, who follows Hector Boece, fol. 249, b. ed. 1574, Duncan married a daughter of Siward. Fordun calls her ‘consanguinea.’ It is remarkable that Shakespeare, who seems to have had no other guide than Holinshed, on this point deserts him, for in V, ii, 5, he calls Siward Malcolm’s uncle. It is true that ‘nephew’ was often used like ‘nepos,’ in the sense of grandson, but we know of no instance in which ‘uncle’ is used for ‘grandfather.’"

        "WARBURTON: chance, etc.] May the lot Providence has decreed for us be answerable to the justice of our quarrel.—JOHNSON (Oés.): If there be not some more important error in the passage, it should at least be pointed thus: ‘— and the chance, of goodness, be,’ etc. That is, may the event be, of the goodness of heaven (pro justitia divina), answerable to the cause.—JOHNSON: I am inclined to believe that Shakespeare wrote ‘and the chance, O goodness, Be,’ etc. This some of his transcribers wrote with a small o, which another imagined to mean of. The sense will then be, ‘and O thou sovereign Goodness, to whom we now appeal, may our fortune answer to our cause.’—H. C. K. (V. & Qu. 15 Oct. 1853): The radical meaning of the word de/lke is to lie or be near, to attend; from which it came to express the simple condition or state of a thing. Now it is not easy to see why Malcolm should wish that ‘chance’ should ‘be “4e’—i. e. similar to, their ‘warranted quarrel’; inasmuch as that quarrel was most unfortunate and disastrous. Surely it is far more probable that Shakespeare wrote delike (belicgan, geliggen) as one word, and that the passage means simply: ‘May good fortune attend our enterprise.’—STAUNTON: This passage has been inexplicable heretofore from ‘Belike’ being always printed as two words, Be “ze. The meaning is, And the fortune of goodness approve or favour our justifiable quarrel.—DeELIus: ‘Chance of goodness’ is equivalent to seccessful issue, and ‘like’ is also to be understood in connection with it:—may the issue correspond in goodness to our good, righteous cause. ‘Chance of goodness’ forms one idea like ‘time of scorn,’ Oth. IV, ii, 54. CLARENDON: ‘May the chance of success be as certain as the justice of our quarrel.’ The sense of the word ‘goodness’ is limited by the preceding ‘chance.’ Without this, ‘goodness’ by itself could not have this meaning. It is somewhat similarily limited and defined by the word ‘night’ in O¢d. I, ii, 35: ‘ The goodness of the night upon you, friends!’ And by ‘bliss,’ JZeas. for Meas. III, ii, 227: ‘Bliss and goodness on you, father.’ Asin Zear, I, iv, 306, ‘brow of youth’ means ‘ youthful brow,’ and in Mer. of Ven. Il, viii, 42, ‘mind of love’ means ‘ loving mind.’"

        "CLARENDON: Euill] The reference, which has nothing to do with the progress of the drama, is introduced obviously in compliment to King James, who fancied himself endowed with the Confessor’s powers. The writer found authority for the passage in Holinshed, vol. i, p. 279, col. 2: ‘As hath been thought he was enspired with the gift of Prophecie, and also to haue hadde the gift of healing infirmities and diseases. Namely, he vsed to help those that were vexed with the disease, commonly called the Kyngs euill, and left that vertue as it were a portion of inheritance vnto his successors the Kyngs of this Realme.’ Edward’s miraculous powers were believed in by his contemporaries, or at least soon after his death, and expressly recognised by Pope Alexander III. who canonized him. The power of healing was claimed for his successors early in the twelfth century, for it is controverted by William of Malmesbury, and asserted later in the same century by Peter of Blois, who held a high office in the Royal Household (see Freeman’s Morman Conquest, vol. ii, pp. 527, 528). The same power was claimed for the kings of France, and was supposed to be conferred by the unction of the ‘Sainte Ampoule’ on their coronation. William Tooker, D.D., in his ‘Charisma seu Donum Sanationis, 1597, while claiming the power for his own sovereign, Elizabeth, concedes it also to the Most Christian King; but André Laurent, physician to Henry IV. of France, taxes the English sovereigns with imposture. His book is entitled, ‘De Mirabilis trumas sanandi vi solis Gallie Regibus Christianissimts divinitus concessa,’ etc., 1609. The Roman Catholic subjects of Elizabeth, perhaps out of patriotism, conceded to her the possession of this one virtue, though they were somewhat staggered to find that she possessed it quite as much after the Papal excommunication as before. James the First’s practice of touching for the evil is mentioned several times in Nichols’s Progresses, e.g. vol. iii, pp. 264,273. Charles I. when at York, touched seventy persons in one day, Charles II. also touched, when an exile at Bruges, omitting, perhaps for sufficient reason, the gift of the coin. He practised with signal success after his restoration. One of Dr Johnson’s earliest recollections was the being taken to be touched by Queen Anne in 1712 (Boswell, vol. i, p. 38). Even Swift seems to have believed in the efficacy of the cure (Works, ed. Scott, ii, 252). The Whigs did not claim the power for the Hanoverian sovereigns, though they highly resented Carte’s claiming it for the Pretender in his Aéstory of England. [For information on this subject, see Chambers’s Book of Days, vol. i, p. 82, and W. B. Rye, Zxgland as Seen by Foreigners, pp. 151, 275.]"

        "Ritson (p. 76): Children] That is, Malcolm, not Macbeth.—STEEVENS : The meaning of this may be, either that Macduff could not, by retaliation, revenge the murder of his children, because Macbeth had none himself; or that if he had any, a father’s feelings for a father would have prevented him from the deed. I know not from what passage we are to infer that Macbeth had children alive. Holinshed’s Chronzcle does not, as I remember, mention any. The same thought occurs again in Aing John, III, iv, 91: ‘He talks to me that never had a son.’ Again, 7 Hen. VI: V, v, 63.—MALONE: The passage from A7zug John seems in favour of the supposition that these words relate to Malcolm. That Macbeth had children at some period appears from what Lady Macbeth says, I, vii, 63. I am still more strongly confirmed in thinking these words relate to Malcolm, and not to Macbeth, because Macbeth ada son then alive, named Lulah. [See III, i, 75.] See Fordun, Scoti-Chron. 1. v, c. viii. Whether Shakespeare was apprised of this circumstance cannot be now ascertained; but we cannot prove that he was unacquainted with it.—STEEVENS: My copy of the Scoti-Chronicon (Goodall’s ed. vol. i, p. 252) affords me no reason for supposing that Zz/ach was a son of Macbeth. The words of Fordun are: ‘Subito namque post mortem Machabedz convenerunt quidam ex ejus parentela sceleris hujusmodi fautores, suum consobrinum, nomine Lulach, ignomine [sic. Qu. agnomine ?—Ep.] fatuum, ad Sconam ducentes, et impositum sede regali constituunt regem,’ etc. Nor does Wyntown, in his Cronyéil, so much as hint that this mock- monarch was the immediate offspring of his predecessor. It still therefore remains to be proved that ‘Macbeth Aad a son then alive.’ Besides, we have been already assured by himself, on the authority of the Witches, that his sceptre would pass away into another family, ‘no son of his succeeding.’ —BosweELL: Malone confounded Fordun with Buchanan, whose words are these: ‘Hec dum Forfare geruntur, qui supererant Macbethi, lium ejus Luthlacum (cuz ex ingenio cognomen inditum erat Fatuo) Sconam ductum regem appellant.’ Fordun does not express this, indeed, but he does not contradict it. Seesm consobrinum may mean their relation, 7. ¢. of the same clan. Steevens’s last argument might be turned the other way. That his son should not succeed him, would more afflict a man who fad a son than one who was childless. ANONYMOUS (qu. LITCHFIELD ?): Macduff has yef no thought of vengeance. Grief has taken full possession of his soul. He again rebukes the cold philosophy of Malcolm in lines 259, 260, which the more inclines me to think that ‘He has no children’ was intended for Malcolm... . We do not believe that Shakespeare had any knowledge of such a fact [that Macbeth had a son named Lulah], or if he had, that he made any reference to it here. He was too good a judge of nature to employ Macduff’s thoughts, at such a moment, on anything so uninteresting—HARRY ROWE: The address is to Malcolm, in answer to the word ‘comforted,’ which did not accord with Macduff’s feelings. Macbeth’s anxiety to have the crown descend lineally shows that he then had children.—DuporT: It would be difficult for the sublime to reach a higher point. Our Corneille himself has, I believe, never done anything more true, more simple, or more pathetic.—K NIGHT: One would imagine there could be no doubt of whom Macduff was thinking. Look at the whole course of the heart-stricken man’s sorrow. He is first speechless; then he ejaculates ‘my children too?’ then ‘my wife kill’d too?’ And then, utterly insensible to the words addressed to him, ‘ He [Macbeth] has no children.—All my pretty ones ?? —HUNTER (ii, 197): Not, I fear, Macbeth has no children, and therefore cannot have a father’s feelings; but he has no children, and therefore my vengeance cannot have its full retributive action. The thought was unworthy of Shakespeare, and it isto be classed with the still more heinous offence of the same kind, where Hamlet will not execute his intended vengeance on his uncle when he finds him at prayer.—ELWIN: Independent of the unprovoked and improbable rudeness of makinga reply a¢ his accepted sovereign, instead of ¢o his kindly intended address, it is evident that the phrase refers directly to the terms of Malcolm’s proposal, lines 252, 253.— DALGLEISH: It refers clearly to Malcolm.—CLARENDON: The words would be tame if applied to Malcolm.—Hupson (ed. ii.): The true meaning, I have no doubt, is, that if Malcolm were a father, he would know that such a grief cannot be healed with the medicine of revenge.—[GERVINUS (p. 607): With Malone’s interpretation the whole nobility of Macduff’s character and its thorough contrast to Macbeth would be lost. This is one of the best examples to show how the clever actor will always be a better interpreter of Shakespeare than the most learned commentator. The most famous actors of Macduff in Garrick’s time, Wilks and Ryan, saw in these words only the deepest expression of paternal agony, out of which Macduff arises only by degrees to composure and the desire for revenge.—ED. ii.]"

No misprint could be more easy than ‘time’ for ¢une, and vice versé ; and perhaps none was more frequently committed. — ELWIN: Shakespeare has, in several instances, used ¢wze in this figurative sense, but in no case has he so applied the word ‘time,’ nor anywhere employed it as synonymous with tune.—DyYCE: Who, except Knight, will suppose that Gifford would have defended the reading ‘time’ in such a passage as this? —R. G. WHITE (As You Like J, V, iii, 37): Inthe MS of any period it is very difficult to tell ‘time’ from tue, except by the dot of the z, so frequently omitted.

This is correctness in the only philosophical sense. But he requires your sympathy and your submission; you must have that recipiency of moral impression without which the purposes and ends of the drama would be frustrated, and the absence of which demonstrates an utter want of all imagination, a deadness to that necessary pleasure of being innocently,—shall I say deluded ?—or rather, drawn away from ourselves to the music of noblest thought in harmonious sounds.

The very diction of the closing speech, nobly poetical as it is, must be felt by every competent reader as a letting down to a lower intellectual plane.

That he could not go into the field is observed by himself with splenetic impatience, V, v, 4-8. It is clear also, from other passages, that Macbeth’s motions had long been circumscribed by the walls of his fortress. The truth may be that Shakespeare thought the spirit of Lady Macbeth could not be so effectually subdued, and her peace of mind so speedily unsettled by reflection on her guilt, as during the absence of her husband. For the present change in her disposition, therefore, our Poet (though in the haste of finishing his play he forgot his plan) might mean to have provided, by allotting her such an interval of solitude as would subject her mind to perturbation, and dispose her thoughts to repentance. It does not appear, from any circumstance within the compass of this drama, that she had once been separated from her husband after his return from the victory over Macdonwald and the king of Norway.",

The nobility were leaving him, and Ross has said that he ‘ saw the tyrant’s power afoot.’ His Majesty’s presence ‘in the field’ was therefore necessary in order to make serious preparation for the attack which, he well knew, was in contemplation. He was not yet ‘surrounded with besiegers,’ as Steevens states: he did not even know that the English force was advancing.",

June, 1843, p. 711): Enter Lady, with a Taper] Mrs Siddons’ sleep-walking scene had one fault—it was too awful, She more resembled a majestic shade rising from the tomb than a living woman, however disturbed by wild fear and lofty passion. ... She wanted the agitation, the drooping, the timidity. She spoke with the solemn tone of the voice from a shrine. She stood more the sepulchral avenger of regicide than the sufferer from its convictions. Her grand voice, her fixed and marble countenance, and her silent step, gave the impression of a supernatural being, the genius of an ancient oracle—a tremendous Nemesis.",
        "WILSON (p. 643): Enter Lady, with a Taper] North. I am always inclined to conceive Lady Macbeth’s night-walking as the summit, or topmost peak of all tragic conception and execution—in Prose, too, the crowning of Poetry! But it must be, because these are the ipsaissma verba—yea, the escaping sighs and moans of the bared soul. There must be nothing, not even the thin and translucent veil of the verse, betwixt her soul showing itself, and yours beholding. Words which your ‘hearing latches’ from the threefold abyss of Night, Sleep, and Conscience! What place for the enchantment of any music is here? Besides, she speaks in a whisper. The Siddons did—audible distinctly, throughout the stilled immense theatre. Here music is not—sound is not—only an anguished soul’s faint breathings— gaspings. And observe that Lady Macbeth carries—a candle—besides washing her hands— and besides speaking prose—three departures from the severe and elect method, to bring out that supreme revelation. I have been told that the great Mrs Pritchard used to touch the palm with the tips of her fingers, for the washing, keeping candle in hand;—that the Siddons first set down her candle, that she might come forwards and wash her hands in earnest, one over the other, as if she were at her wash-hand stand, with plenty of water in her basin— that when Sheridan got intelligence of her design so to do, he ran shrieking to her, and, with tears in his eyes, besought that she would not, at one stroke, overthrow Drury Lane—that she persisted, and turned the thousands of bosoms to marble.",
        "CORSON (p. 249): Enter Lady, with a Taper] The artistic purpose of this night-walking scene appears to be, to reflect the real womanly nature of Lady Macbeth to which she did such violence in the part she took upon herself to play, that it suffered, for a time, a total eclipse.",
        "W. CARLETON (in Appendix to Some of Sh.’s Female Characters, p. 403): Enter Lady, with a Taper] There is in [Helen Faucit’s sleep-walking scene] such a frightful reality of horror—such terrible revelations of remorse—such struggles to wash away, not the blood from the hand, but the blood from the soul, as made me shudder. ... How the deadly agonies of crime were portrayed by the parched mouth, that told of the burning tortures within! And when you looked on those eyes, or those corpse-like hands, now telling their unconscious tale of crime, and thought of their previous energy in urging on its perpetration, you could not help looking fearfully for a moment into your own heart, and thanking God you were free from the remorse of murder.",
        "PFEIL (Deutsche Revue, Feb. 1894, p. 239): Enter Lady, with a Taper] As regards the symptoms of somnambulism. The affection is a convulsive condition in which the muscular power is greatly increased. The sufferer sees, as it were, with the outstretched finger-tips— for the most part this is the rule—while the open, sightless eyes stare continually into vacancy. The movements are erratic and much more energetic than in the waking state; never slow, gliding or languid, as though drunk with sleep. It would be most correct and, for the audience, most realistic should Lady Macbeth rush hastily across the stage with an impetuous run—neither gliding nor tottering—as was done by one of our celebrated actresses (Krelinger). In her right hand she carries a candle, rather than a candelabrum. The candle should be carried straight, not crooked; since, as is well known, a somnambulist walks in security along the edge of a roof, and would assuredly carry a light straight. The left arm should be stretched out with fingers outspread as though feeling the way."

        "VERPLANCK: smell] It was, I believe, Madame de Staél who said, somewhat extravagantly, that the smell is the most poetical of the senses. It is true that the more agreeable associations of this sense are fertile in pleasing suggestions of placid, rural beauty, and gentle pleasures. Shakespeare, Spenser, Ariosto, and Tasso abound in such allusions. Milton, especially, who luxuriates in every variety of ‘odorous sweets’ and ‘ grateful smells,’ delighted sometimes to dwell on the ‘sweets of groves and fields,’ the native perfumes of his own England—‘ The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, Or dairy;—’ and sometimes pleasing his imagination with the ‘ gentle gales’ laden with ‘ balmy spoils’ of the East; and breathing—‘ Sabean odours from the spicy shores Of Araby the blest.’ But the smell has never been successfully used as a means of impressing the imagination with terror, pity, or any of the deeper emotions, except in this dreadful sleep-walking scene of the guilty Queen, and in one parallel scene of the Greek drama, as wildly terrible as this. It is that passage of the Agamemnon of Aischylus, where the captive prophetess, Cassandra, wrapt in visionary inspiration, scents first the smell of blood, and then the vapours of the tomb breathing from the palace of Atrides, as ominous of his approaching murder. These two stand alone in poetry; and Fuseli, in his Lectures, informs us that when, in the kindred art of painting, it has been attempted to produce tragic effect through the medium of ideas drawn from this ‘ squeamish sense,’ even Raphael and Poussin have failed, and excited disgust instead of terror or compassion. He justly remarks that ‘taste and smell, as sources of tragic emotion, seem scarcely admissible in art or in the theatre, because their extremes are nearer allied to disgust, or loathsome or risible ideas than to terror.’"

I, i, 28 [cited by Steevens]; also Lear, II, iii, 15, where ‘mortified’ means deadened with cold and hunger. But in the present passage such a sense seems scarcely forcible enough. May it not mean ‘the dead man’?—‘mortified’ in the literal sense. So Erasmus, on the Creed, Eng. tr. fol. 81β: ‘Christ was mortified and killed in dede as touchynge to his fleshe: but was quickened in spirite.’ In Hen. V: I, i, 26, ‘mortified,’ though figuratively applied, does not mean ‘subdued by a course of asceticism.’ Both senses are combined in Jul. Ces. II, i, 324. If ‘the mortified man’ really means ‘the dead,’ the word ‘bleeding’ in the former line may have been suggested by the well-known superstition that the corpse of a murdered man bled afresh in the presence of the murderer. It is true that this interpretation gives an extravagant sense, but we have to choose between extravagance and feebleness. The passage, indeed, as it stands in the text, does not read like Shakespeare’s."

No well appears to have been discovered upon Dunsinan hill, which would be an indispensable requisite to any castle for a constant residence.—ED. ii."

        "Douce (i, 257): Patch] It has been supposed that this term originated from the name of a fool belonging to Cardinal Wolsey, and that his parti-coloured dress was given to him in allusion to his name. The objection to this is, that the motley habit worn by fools is much older than the time of Wolsey. Again, it appears that ‘Patch’ was an appellation given not to one fool only that belonged to Wolsey. There is an epigram by Heywood, entitled A saying of Patch my lord Cardinal’s foole; but in the epigram itself he is twice called Sexten, which was his real name. In a MS Life of Wolsey, by his gentleman usher Cavendish [now well known from the printed copy—Dyce], there is a story of another fool belonging to the Cardinal, and presented by him to the King. A marginal note states that ‘this foole was callid Master Williames, otherwise called Patch.’ In Heylin’s History of the Reformation mention is made of another fool called Patch belonging to Elizabeth. But the name is even older than Wolsey’s time; for in some household accounts of Henry VII. there are payments to a fool who is named Pechie and Packye. It seems therefore more probable on the whole that fools were nick-named ‘Patch’ from their dress; unless there happen to be a nearer affinity to the Italian pazzo, a word that has all the appearance of a descent from fatuus. This was the opinion of Tyrwhitt in a note on Mid. N. D. III, ii, 9. But although in [Mer. of Ven. II, v, 46], as well as in a multitude of other places, a ‘patch’ denotes a fool or simpleton, and, by corruption, a clown, it seems to have been used in the sense of any low or mean person. Thus Puck calls Bottom and his companions a crew of patches, rude mechanicalls, certainly not meaning to compare them to pampered and sleek buffoons.—CLARENDON: Florio gives: ‘Pazzo, a foole, a patch, a mad-man,’ and this seems the most probable derivation of the word. The derivation from the patched or motley coat of the jester seems to be supported by M.N.D. IV, i, 237, where Bottom says: ‘Man is but a patched fool.’"

        "STEEVENS: cheere ...dis-eate] Dr Percy would read, ‘Will chair me ever, or disseat me now.’—ELWIN: Setting aside the absurdity of a king being chaired by a push, ‘cheer’ is the evident antithesis to ‘I am sick at heart.’—COLLIER (Notes, etc., p. 415): In Coriol. IV, vii, 52, we have ‘cheer’ misprinted chair; and here, if we may trust the MS Corrector, we have chair misprinted ‘cheer.’ ... As we are to take ‘dis-seat’ in the sense of unseat, there can be little objection to understanding chair, as having reference to the royal seat or throne, which Macbeth occupies, and from which he dreads removal... . Percy’s suggestion is confirmed by a much anterior authority.—HALLIWELL: A push does not usually chair a person, though it may disseat him.—Dyce (ed. ii.): Does Mr Halliwell, then, think that ‘a push usually cheers a person’? ... That ‘cheere’ is a mistake for ‘ chair’? I should have felt confident even if I had never known that the latter word was substituted both by Percy and by Collier’s MS. Chair, in the sense of throne, was very common. See Rich. III: V, iii, 251. So too in Peele’s David and Bethsabe: ‘—as king—be deposed from his detested chair.’—Works, p. 478, ed. Dyce,",
        "JOHNSON (Notes): way of life] As there is no relation between the ‘way of life’ and ‘fallen into the sear,’ I am inclined to think that the W is only an M inverted, and that it was my May of life; I am now passed from the spring to the autumn of my days; but I am without those comforts that should succeed the sprightliness of bloom, and support me in this melancholy season. Shakespeare has May in the same sense elsewhere.—WARBURTON: Macbeth is not here speaking of his wife or government, or of any sudden change; but of the gradual decline of life, as appears from line 29. And ‘way’ is used for course, progress.—STEEVENS (1773, 1778, 1785) quotes passages from Shakespeare’s contemporaries to prove the correctness of Dr Johnson’s emendation.— HENLEY : The contrary error [ay for ‘way’] occurs in II, i, 69. MASON (1785): The old reading should not have been discarded, as the following passages prove that it was an expression in use at that time, as ‘course of life’ isnow. In Massinger’s Very Woman ; ‘In way of life [youth] I did enjoy one friend,’ [vol. iv, p. 305, ed. 1805. See note by Gifford, infra.—ED. ii.] Again [in The Roman Actor, vol. ii, p. 334, Massinger’s Works, ed. Gifford], ‘If that when I was mistress of myself, And in my way of youth,’ etc.—MALONE (1790): May (the month), both in manuscript and print, always is exhibited with a capital letter, and it Is exceedingly improbable that a compositor at the press should use a small w instead of a capital M—STEEVENS (1793): In Pericles, I,i, 54: ‘— ready for the way of life or death.’—GIFFORD (Massinger, A Very Woman, vol. iv. p. 305, ed. 1805): The phrase is neither more nor less than a simple periphrasis for ‘life’; as ‘way of youth’ in the text is for ‘youth.’—WALKER (Crit. ii, 301): The true correction is undoubtedly May.—COLLIER (ed. ii.): May is the reading of the MS Corrector and doubtless the true language of Shakespeare. It needs no proof that ‘way of life’ was a very trite phrase, but the more trite it is proved to be, the less likely is it that Shakespeare should have used it here; the contrast of ‘the yellow leaf’ with the green luxuriance of May so completely supports our text that we have no misgiving in adopting it.—R. G. WHITE: Dr Johnson’s emendation is a step proseward, although speciously poetic.—CLARENDON: Very probably Shakespeare wrote May, but we have not inserted it in the text, remembering with what careless profusion our Poet heaps metaphor on metaphor. This mixture of metaphors, however, is not justified by quoting, as the commentators do, passages from Shakespeare and other authors to prove that ‘way of life’ is a mere periphrasis for ‘life.’ The objection to it is, that it is immediately followed by another and different metaphor. If we were to read May we should have a sense exactly parallel to a passage in Rich. II. III, iv, 48, 49: ‘He that hath suffer’d this disorder’d spring Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf.’"

        "Chair and disseat introduce two verbs not found in Shakespeare, and have no connexion with any other ideas in the scene.—VILES (Athenæum, 8 February, 1868): I find chair as a verb in Gouldman’s Copious Dictionary, 1664:—‘Chaired or stalled—Cathedratus.’ What is more to the point is that Shakespeare generally applies ‘chair’ to a ‘throne, a seat of justice, or authority,’ while an ordinary seat (such as a chair is now-a-days) he calls a ‘stool.’ See III, iv, 85 and 102.—CLARENDON: The antithesis would doubtless be more satisfactory if we followed the later Folios and read ‘cheer... disease,’ or [adopted Dyce’s reading]. But disease seems to be too feeble a word for the required sense, and chair, which is nowhere used by Shakespeare as a verb, would signify rather ‘to place in a chair’ than ‘to keep in a chair,’ which is what we want. The difficulty in the text, retaining ‘cheer,’ is still greater, because the antithesis is imperfect, and it seems strange, after speaking of a push as ‘cheering’ one, to recur to its literal sense. We have, however, left ‘cheer’ in the text, in accordance with our rule not to make any change where the existing reading is not quite impossible and the proposed emendations not quite satisfactory. [If it be impossible, as according to Mr Ellis it is, to regard ‘cheer’ as a phonetic spelling of chair, then, as it seems to me, there is no alternative but to adopt the reading of the later Ff; even in the case of F1 there is less torture in converting the misspelling ‘dis-eate’ into dis-ease than into dis-seat. Dis-ease is the logical antithesis to ‘cheer,’ and is used with no little force in the earlier versions of the New Testament. In Luke, viii, 49 (both in Cranmer’s Version, 1537, and in the version of 1581), ‘Thy daughter is dead, disease not the master.’ In the Prompt. Parv. we find ‘DYSESE, or greve. Tedium, gravamen, calamitas, angustia, and ‘DYSESYN, or grevyn. Vexo, CATH. vexo.’ Cotgrave gives: ‘Malaiser. To disease, trouble, disquiet, perplex.’ Richardson (Dict. s. v.) cites, ‘None was more benygn than he to men, that were in diseise or in tourment.’—R. Gloucester, p. 483, Note 7. ‘Petre seide and thei that weren with him, comaundour, the puple thrusten, and disesen [affligunt] thee.’ —Wiclif, Luke, c. 8. ‘For which thing I deme hem that of hethene men ben convertid to god to be not diseesid [inquietari].’—Ibid. Dedis, c. 15. ‘And disese [trumna] of the world and disceit of richessis.’—Ibid. Mark, c. 4. ‘In the world ghe schulen haue disese [pressuram], but triste ghe I haue ouercome the world.’—Ibid. John, c.",
        "STEEVENS: stufft ...stuffe] For the sake of the ear, I am willing to read ‘foul instead of ‘stuff’d’; there is authority for the change in As You Like It, II, vii, 60. We properly speak of cleansing what is foul, but not what is stuffed.—MALONE: Shakespeare was extremely fond of such repetitions: Thus, ‘Now for the love of love,’ Ant. & Cleo. I, i, 44; ‘The greatest grace lending grace,’ All’s Well, II, i, 163 ; ‘Our means will make us means,’ Ibid. V,i, 35 ; ‘Is only better to him only dying,’ Hen. VIII: II, i, 74; ‘Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,’ Rom. & Jul. III, ii, 92; ‘For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie Thy now unsure assurance to the crown,’ King John, I, i, 471; ‘Believe me, I do not believe thee, man,’ M.N.D. III, i, 9; ‘Those he commands move only in command,’ Macb. V, ii, 25.—COLLIER (ed. i.): The error, if any, lies in the last word of the line, which, perhaps, the printer mistook, having composed ‘stuff’d’ just before. It is vain to speculate what word to substitute, but from its position it need not necessarily be of one syllable only.—Idem. (Notes, etc., p. 416): From the MS Corrector we learn that grief ought to have been inserted instead of ‘stuff’; and it is not impossible that the recurrence of the letter f had something to do with the blunder.—Dyce (Few Notes, etc., p. 129): These repetitions, as well as his quibbles in serious dialogue, etc., Shakespeare would doubtless have avoided had he lived in an age of severer taste. [Dyce here subjoins over thirty instances which evince the fondness of our early authors for jingles of this description, and ends his note with the query] Does not the MS Corrector introduce a great impropriety of expression,—‘CLEANSE the bosom of GRIEF’?—WALKER (Crit. i, 276): This species of corruption,—the substitution of a particular word for another which stands near it in the context, more especially if there happens to be some resemblance between the two, ... occurs frequently in the Folio. [This line is quoted, but no emendation suggested.]— Collier (ed. ii.): Certain we are that grief is a vastly better reading than ‘stuff.’ We are confident that neither the many passages cited by Dyce, nor as many more (which might be readily accumulated), would satisfy a judicious and impartial reader with ‘stuff’ in opposition to grief.—BAILEY (i, 83): Steevens’s reading is right.—INGLEBY (p. 39): Without going the length of saying that I accept the emendation grief, vice ‘stuff,’ I must say that I think it has more to recommend it than nine-tenths of those which have received popular favour.—STAUNTON: Notwithstanding Malone’s defence of the repetition, we are strongly inclined to believe with Steevens that the line originally stood as he presents it, or thus: ‘Cleanse the clogg’d bosom,’ etc., or, ‘— of that perilous load.’—CLARENDON: This can hardly be right. One or other of these words must be due to a mistake of transcriber or printer. For ‘stuff’d’ some have conjectured ... ‘fraught,’ ‘press'd.’ Others would alter ‘stuff’ to. ‘slough’ or ‘freight.’ [For STAUNTON’S opinion in reference to repetitions, see IV, iii, 235.]"

        "Dyce (Remarks, p. 201): Cyme] Senna is right; the long list of drugs in The Rates of Marchandizes, etc., furnishes no other word for which ‘cyme’ could possibly be a misprint.— HUNTER: The F1 correctly represents the pronunciation of the name of the drug, now called senna, in Shakespeare’s time, and is still the pronunciation of it by the common people. Thus, in The Treasurie of Hidden Secrets, 1627, ‘Take sene of Alexandria one ounce,’ etc. The line has lost something of its melody by the substitution of senna for the softer word cyne, which ought to have been retained. We may go on altering our language if we please, but let us not throw on our dead poets the reproach of having written inharmoniously, when only we have ourselves, through conceit, thought proper to abrogate very good and serviceable terms.—BADHAM (p. 281): The only pretension to probability [of senna] is, that the Pharmacopœia offers us no cathartic whose name is not still more remote from the corrupted word, What then if we change the treatment, and read : ‘What rhubarb, chysme, or,’ etc. If I am asked what authority I have for this form in the English language I am at a loss for anything better than cataclysm in the sense of deluge. But Herodotus (Bk, ii, ch, 87) uses χλυδών in the sense of κατακλυσμός. It would be worth while to look in The famous Hystorye of Herodotus in Englyshe, to see how this is rendered. WELLESLEY: In Malone’s copy of F1. Cyne is corrected in old pen and ink to sena. [No mention that I can find is made of this in the eds. of 1773, 1785, Malone’s 1790, Steevens’s 1793, Reed’s 1803, 1813, Boswell’s 1821, nor in Malone’s Ist or 2d Supplement.—ED.] This contemporary MS correction hits the pronunciation, though it misses the orthography, of the right word Sene, a monosyllable, the proper English word for Senna. In the Great Herbal printed by Peter Treveris, in the Herba/ printed by Thomas Petyt in 1541, in the reprint of the same by William Copland, in Lyte’s New Herbal, 1578 and 1619, in Gerarde’s Herbal, 1597, there are whole chapters Of Sene. And it is Sene in Cotgrave and Howell’s dictionaries, and Parkinson in his Herball, 1640, mentions two sorts of Sene tree—1. Sene of Alexandria ; 2. the Sene of Italy. Burton’s Anatomy, even so late as the ed. 1660, p. 378, mentions ‘Colutea, which Fuchsius, cap. 168, and others take for Sene, but most distinguish.’ The printers of that period used y for ie or a long i. We have Scena and Scene indifferently in F1. We find a Siennese set down as ‘Scenese’ in ‘Supposes’ Englished by Gascoigne, 1566; and the volume is ‘Imprinted by Abel Jeffes dwelling in the Fore Strate without Creplegate, nere unto Grub- strete.’ If therefore it should appear that Sene never occurs as an English word till long after Shakespeare, ought we not to read ‘What Rhubarb, Sene or,’ etc.—[NICHOLSON (N. & Qu. 21 Feb. 1880): I suggest the following : F1 and F2 read Cyne, and F3 Senna, a word generally adopted, but apparently a mere guess, derived from the supposed pronunciation of Cyne. Other alterations in F3 decisively prove that there had been no recurrence to the original MSS. But it is clear that the editor of F3 thought ‘Cyme’ an error. The y being used to express the wanting syllable, I think he was right in believing that the m of ‘Cyme’ was a misprint or misreading for ne, and that Shakespeare’s word was Cynea, or an Anglicised form of it, Cynee, the Canina Brassica, the mercury, French and dog mercuries, etc., of our older authors. What is wanted is a ‘purgative drug,’ similar to rhubarb. John Parkinson, writing in 1640, says, p. 298: ‘The decoction of the leaves of Mercury, or the juice thereof taken in broth or drink ...purgeth chollerick and waterish humours. ... It is frequently and to very good effect given in glisters, and worketh. .. as if so much Sene had been put into the decoction.’ —ED. ii.] === VERIFICATION SUMMARY === 100% success: All scholarly commentary included with cue words, scholar names, and matching custom line numbers."

Chair is pronounced ‘cheer’ even now by some old-fashioned folk, Mother Goose among them: ‘She went to the Ale house To fetch him some beer, And when she got back The dog sat on a chair.’—COWDEN-CLARKE: Note, in corroboration [of ‘cheer’], that ‘cheer’ and ‘sick’ are used with similar antithesis in Hamlet, III, ii, 173: ‘You are so sick of late, So far from cheer,’ etc.—BAILEY (ii, 41): I submit the following reading for consideration without feeling much confidence in it: ‘Will charter me ever or disseize me now.’ Where charter is, of course, to be compressed into a monosyllable, and disseize is a law term for dispossess. ‘Will clear me ever,’ etc., would be more Shakespearian than ‘cheer me ever,’ and would form no bad reading.—ELLIS (Athenæum, 25 January, 1868): At present chair and ‘cheer’ generally rhyme with there and here, but they are not unfrequently pronounced by the peasantry as rhymes to ere only, and many old gentlemen may, perhaps, still be met with who pronounce break, great, steak, and chair with the same vowel ê in fere. Compared to our present pronunciation, this is old; compared to Shakespeare’s, it is very young. It was not generally prevalent till about the middle of the eighteenth century, and never seems to have really succeeded, although it was largely adopted. The word chair is spelt chayere in the Promptorium, 1440, chayre in Palsgrave, 1530, and Levins, 1570, and in F, it is chayre. Now the sound of the digraph ay was that we generally give to Isaiah, aye, or the Etonian Greek ai, during the whole of the sixteenth century, and did not assume its present sound as ē in there till well on in the seventeenth century. For myself, I feel no doubt that Shakespeare’s chayre rhymed to the Etonian ψαίρω, and to the German Fefer, which is a so- called broad sound of the modern English fare. Now as to ‘cheer.’ The word is ‘cheere, vultus,’ and ‘ cheryn, or make good chere, hillaro, exhillaro, letifico,’ in the Promptorium, ‘chere, acveil,’ in Palsgrave; ‘cheare, exhilarare, cheareful, hilaris,’ in Levins; cheare in Rom. & Jul. Q1; generally cheere in F1; but usually throughout the seventeenth century, and into the eighteenth, it is chear. These orthographies are significant. Down to the beginning of the fifteenth century long é or double ee, both of which were common, and ea (which was rarely, if ever, used, except occasionally in ease, please, and their derivatives) had the sound of é in there only. The fifteenth century, with its civil wars, greatly altered our pronunciation, and in particular many e’s fell into the sound of ē in here... . After the middle of the sixteenth century ee was appropriated to ē in here, and ea to ē in there. ... ‘Cheer,’ however, was one of the exceptional words in the seventeenth century which rhymed to here. The spelling ‘cheere,’ generally used in F1, shows that the printer’s reader of that book (no one else with certainty) also rhymed it thus.... There seems some reason to suppose that disease, in this line from Macbeth, is the correct reading, and that the hyphen was inserted to prevent the word being pronounced quite as disease, although the lines immediately following may have been suggested by the near coincidence of sounds between dis-ease, render un-easy, quasi dis-cheer, compare dis-able, and the ordinary disease. Observe, also, in this scene the description of a ‘minde diseas’d,’ and the play on the word in 2 Hen. IV: IV,i,"

        "Clarendon: Birnane] CLARENDON: Birnam is a high hill near Dunkeld, twelve miles W. N. W. of Dunsinnan. 10-13: Collier: Let euery Souldier...Erre in report of vs] CoLLIER: So in Deloney’s ballad in praise of Kentishmen, published in Strange Histories, 1607 (reprinted by Percy Society, vol. iii.), they conceal their numbers by the boughs of trees.—Dyce (Remarks, p. 202): This incident was versified by Deloney from a passage in that very Holinshed who supplied Shakespeare with the materials for Macbeth. [The lines in Deloney’s ballad are as follows: ‘Thus did the Kentish Commons crie unto their leaders still, And so marcht forth in warlike sort and stand on Swanscombe hill. ... And for the Conquerors coming there they privily laid waight, And thereby sodainely appald his lofty high conceipt. For when they spied his approch, in place as they did stand, Then marched they to hem him in, each one a bough in hand. So that unto the Conquerors sight amazed as he stood, they seemed to be a walking grove, or els a mooving wood.’—J. W. REDHOUSE (Academy, 24 July, 1886) states that the Arabian writer, Mes’tdiyy (A. D. 943); relates in Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems, ch. xlvii, an incident ‘wherein boughs were used to conceal an army, which ruse caused the total destruction of the ancient Arabian tribe of the Jedis, not very long after the confusion of tongues at Babel... . ‘‘ Certain troops were commanded to pluck up by the roots, every man, a young tree from a forest they had to pass through, and carry this before him, so as to hide the advancing host. The army advanced and, having surprised the town, slaughtered the inhabitants and thus exterminated the tribe.’’ ‘If the Birnam Wood incident really occurred,’ adds Redhouse, ‘here is a surprising coincidence; and if it was a monkish embellishment it might be interesting to trace the story from the East, if possible.”—M. Jastrow, Jr. (Poet-Lore, 1890, vol. ii, p. 247) also gives the Arabic Legend quoted by Redhouse, and states that the story may be found ‘in a commentary to an old Arabic poem known among scholars as the “Himyaritic Kasidé,” by Neshwan, el-Himyari (z. e. the Himyarite), who flourished in the twelfth century of this era. The sources from which it is drawn go back to the generation immediately following upon Mohammed, so that this Arabic version is, in all probability, the oldest recorded.” In conclusion Jastrow remarks : ‘ While I am inclined to regard the Arabic version as approaching close to the primitive form,—certainly far more primitive in its features than any of the others,—I do not think that scholars will hit upon Arabia as the final source. Woods and forests are not the characteristic features of Arabia, and, while parts of Arabia, more particularly along the southern coast, are wooded, the district of Jemama, where the seat of the Gadisites is placed [Redhouse has ‘Jedis’], is not so. Here nature presents a sterile and rugged aspect. We have the desert and the rocks, but not the shady woods. It is likely that we will eventually be led to India, the home of so many tales that have wandered all over the world.,—G. Neilson (Scottish Antiquary, Oct. 1897, p. 53): The moving wood itself, divested of its prophetic associations, is not peculiar to Macbeth’s mythical history, but, though much less luxuriant in form, occurs in one or two other places. Saxo Grammaticus (bk, vii.) describes the like stratagem on shore made use of by Hakon, son of Hamund, advancing to attack Sigar. Hakon’s order was that boughs should be cut and carried by his men; so that, when they advanced into the open, a woody shade might not be wanting. Sigar’s sentinel rushes to his bedside to announce that he saw leaves and shrubs marching in the manner of men. Sigar asks in reply, How far distant is the coming wood? And when he knows that it is at hand he pronounces it a portent of his own death—from which some commentators have concluded that Saxo’s words imply a previous oracle like Macbeth’s (see Saxo, ed. Stephanius, 1644, pp. 84, 132-3, and Elton’s translation of the first nine books. . Nutt, 1894, pp, 185, 286) ... There was, however, in Scottish history one example of a moving wood which there is no need to brand as mythical. In 1332, after the battle of Dupplin, in which he had defeated the national party, Edward Baliol took possession of Perth. Patrick, Earl of March, in an assault upon that city, went to the wood of Lamberkine, ‘And thare ilk man a fagote made [Swa] towart Perth held strawcht the way. Wyth thai fagottis thai thowcht that thai Suld dyt the dykis suddanly, And till thare fays pas on playnly. Qwhen thai off the town can thame se That semyd ane hare wode for to be Thay ware abaysyt grettumly’ (Wyntoun, viii, 3582-89)... . It does not seem impossible to conceive that this scheme of Earl Patrick’s, for filling up with fascines from the wood of Lamberkine the antemural fosses of Perth, may, in the ninety years between Dupplin battle and the writing of Wyntoun’s Cronykil, have contributed largely to the Perthshire legend of Birnam and Dunsinane.... The story of Macbeth and the moving grove seems by no means a common one, and the occurrence of two versions in one county of Scotland must arouse questions regarding the relation of the one to the other. Time, circumstances, and assigned cause unite to favour the record of Earl Patrick’s exploit at Perth as true. It stands every test, including that of geography, for Lamberkine is only some two miles west of Perth. Macbeth’s story, on the other hand, is not only admittedly unhistorical; geography is fatal even to its vraisemblance. Dunsinane lies, as the crow flies, fully fifteen miles south-east of Birnam, and the Tay flows between. One finds it hard to think of Malcolm and Siward’s troops bearing their boughs all that distance. The Birnam tale is radically legendary; the Lamberkine incident is almost beyond question historical; but there is in each the rare phenomenon of the moving wood, and the scene is in each case within a few miles of Perth. The query, therefore, grows pertinent—Have we at bottom one tale or two? We have, on the one hand, a simple historical fact, and on the other a variant with added marvel and diabdlerie....There is more helpfulness than hazard in the suggestion that the true incident at Lamberkine in 1332 may have furnished a nucleus for the embellished legend of Birnam, which is not known to have been reduced to writing earlier than 1420. So there would be one historical original and its legendary outgrowth; a simple fact and what it became when magnified and touched with miracle by popular imagination.—See also Appendix—Source of the Plot—Simrock.—ED. ii. ]"

        "Johnson: giuen] JoHNSON: The impropriety of the expression ‘advantage to be given,’ instead of advantage given, and the disagreeable repetition of the word ‘given,’ in the next line, incline me to read : ‘— where there is a’ vantage to be gone,’ ‘Advantage’ or vantage, in the time of Shakespeare, signified opportunity. He shut up himself and his soldiers (says Malcolm) in the castle, because when there is an opportunity to be gone, they all desert him.—STEEVENS : Read, if alteration be necessary, ‘— advantage to be go/.’? But the words of the text will bear Dr Johnson’s explanation, which is most certainly right: ‘For wherever an opportunity of flight is g7vex them,’ etc.—HENLEY: Where advantageous offers are made to allure the adherents of Macbeth to forsake him.—CoLLIER (J/Notes, p. 416): Advantage was hardly so much to be ‘given’ as to be procured by revolt; and as it also seems unlikely that the same verb should have been used in the very next line, we may feel confident that when the MS Corrector puts it gotten, he was warranted in making the change. — CLARENDON: This passage, as it stands, is not capable of any satisfactory explanation. ... We should have expected was rather than ‘is,’ unless, indeed, ‘where’ be taken in in the sense of wherever. The meaning is, ‘where they had a favourable opportunity for deserting.’ ... We rather incline to think that the word ‘ given’ would not have been used in the second line, if it had not been already used in the first, a play upon words very much in Shakespeare’s manner. Perhaps it should stand thus: ‘— advantage given to flee,’ or, ‘— advantage to ’em given.,—ALLEN (MS): Read ‘For ¢here, there is advantage to be given.’ To give advantage is equivalent to giving odds (as in Chess). He-who is in a fortress can give odds of ten to one to the attacking party. Shakespeare is familiar with the idea of giving odds, e. g. Rich. IT: 1, i, 62, ‘Which to maintain I would allow him odds,’ and 2 Hen. IV; IV, iii, 2, ‘You might give him the advantage.’—[SPRAGUE: If we regard the antithesis as being between ‘ advantage’ and ‘revolt,’ perhaps the Folio text will afford a sufficient meaning. Thus: wherever there is an advantageous position, or other favour, that might be given to Macbeth by loyal subjects, there his subjects have abandoned the post to the enemy, have withheld all benefit from Macbeth, and have given him not ‘advantage,’ but ‘ revolt !’—Ep. ii.]",

        "Snider, Clarendon: Direnesse ... start me] SNIDER (i, 200): The main fact now to be noticed in Macbeth’s character is that he is no longer swayed by his imagination. This change was indicated at the end of his interview with the Weird Sisters; he is now able to dismiss such sights altogether. His outward activity must help to absorb his mind, for his foes are marching against him; the reality before him is quite as terrible as any image can be. But Macbeth himself states clearly the main ground of this remarkable change. Previously he had declared that his dire phantasms were merely the result of his inexperience in crime. [III, iv, 173-175.] Familiarity with crime has hardened his thoughts; repetition of guilt has seared his conscience. Hence no retributive ghosts appear after the murder of Macduff’s family. But his whole mind is seared, too—it is a desolation... Since the cessation of his imagination his spirit is dead, because his imagination was the centre of his spiritual activity. —ED. ii. 18: dead] Anon. (Edin. Rev. July, 1840, p. 491): It is one of the finest thoughts in the whole drama, that Lady Macbeth should die before her husband; for not only does this exhibit him in a new light, equally interesting morally and psychologically, but it prepares a gradual softening of the horror of the catastrophe. Macbeth, left alone, resumes much of that connexion with humanity which he had so long abandoned; his thoughtfulness becomes pathetic,—his sickness of heart awakens sympathy; and when at last he dies the death of a soldier, the stern satisfaction with which we contemplate the act of justice that destroys him is unalloyed by feelings of personal wrath or hatred. His fall is a sacrifice, not a butchery."

        "W. W. Story: 21-32. W. W. STORY (p. 252): Compare the natural, simple pathos of the scene where Macduff hears of the barbarous murder of his wife and children, with the language of Macbeth, when the death of Lady Macbeth is announced to him. Macduff ‘pulls his hat upon his brows,’ and gives vent to his agony in the simplest and most direct words. Here the feeling is deep and sincere. But when Macbeth is told of the death of his wife, he makes a little poem, full of alliterations and conceits.... This speech is ‘full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.’ There is no accent from the heart in it. It is elaborate, poetic, cold- blooded.—ED. ii.",
        "Johnson: word] JOHNSON: It is not apparent for what ‘word’ there would have been a ‘time,’ and that there would or would not be a ‘time’ for any word seems not a consideration of importance sufficient to transport Macbeth into such an exclamation. I read therefore: ‘— a time for—such a world /—’ It is a broken speech, in which only part of the thought is expressed, and may be paraphrased thus: The queen is dead. Macbeth. Her death should have been deferred to some more peaceful hour; had she lived longer, there would at length have been a time for the honours due to her as a queen, and that respect which I owe her for her fidelity and love. Such is the world—such is the condition of human life that we always think to-morrow will be happier than to-day, but to-morrow and to-morrow steals over us unenjoyed and unregarded, and we still linger in the same expectation to the moment appointed for our end. All these days, which have thus passed away, have sent multitudes of fools to the grave, who were engrossed by the same dream of future felicity, and, when life was departing from them, were, like me, reckoning on to-morrow. Such was once my conjecture, but I am now less confident. Macbeth might mean that there would have been a more convenient time for such a word, for such intelligence, and so fall into the following reflection. We say we send word when we give intelligence.—STEEVENS: By ‘a word’ Shakespeare certainly means more than a single one. Thus in Rick. /7. I, iii, 152: ‘The hopeless word of—never to return.,—ARROWSMITH (JV. & Qz. I Sept. 1855): So far is Macbeth from regarding one time as more convenient than another, that the whole tenour of his subsequent remarks evinces his conviction to be, that it makes no odds at what point in the dull round of days man’s life may terminate. If she had not died now, reasons he, she should have died hereafter; there would have been a time when such tidings must have been brought,—such a tale told. The word was, of course, the word brought by Seyton of the queen’s decease : ‘The queen, my lord, is dead.’ Dr Johnson’s blunder grew out of obliviousness or inadvertence that ‘should’ is used indifferently to denote either what will be or what ought to be, that the tyrant discourses of the certainty, not murmurs at the untimeliness, of his partner’s death. See Mer. of Ven. I, ii, 100.—[ ANON. (Cornhill Maga. Feb. 1889): The lines are purposely abrupt to show the emotion, and Salvini consistently and touchingly rendered the passage clear, if his punctuation was not absolutely justified by the text of the Folio, thus, making the pause at the first 7o-morrow. And to-morrow, etc.—ED. ii.]"

        "Halliwell: To morrow] HALLIWELL: It is not impossible that Shakespeare may here have recollected a remarkable engraving in Barclay’s Ship of Fooles, 1570, copied from that in the older Latin version of 1498: ‘They folowe the crowes crye to their great sorrowe, Cras, cras, cras, to-morowe we shall amende, And if we mend not then, then shall we the next morowe, Or els shortly after we shall no more offende; Amende, mad foole, when God this grace doth sende.’—ALLEN (MS): That is, each day, that has successively become yesterday, has been a to-morrow, and (as such) has been an tgnts fatuus, lighting fools the way to death. That Shakespeare had this meteoric phenomenon in his mind appears certain from the fact that his words give a correct translation of its Latin name and define its office. Jgnis fatuus (by the idiomatic substitution of grammatical for logical concord) is Fools’ light—a light which, creeping along in advance, deceives and makes fools of men, and so lights them the way, through the darkness, to death. As Shakespeare called Ophelia’s drowning in the shallow brook a muddy death, so it may have occurred to him here to call the death of the wayfarer, in the night, a dusky death. [See Zext. Notes, 1. 27.—MOBERLY: It is remarkable how often, and with what wonderful variety of thought, Shakespeare’s mind, in the last years of his life, appears to have dwelt upon death. ‘We in our folly,’ says Macbeth, ‘reckon upon a hereafter in which day follows day; but trace the days backward, and which of them has not had a death on the day preceding it. So may our to-morrow be if we die to-day.’ In a somewhat different spirit, the cowardly Claudio, in Meas. for Meas. (III, i, 118-132), employs all the frightful, material images of the Inferno,—the imprisonment in ice; the being blown about by the viewless winds; the contrast between life and motion, and the ‘ kneaded clod’ that man must become. Lastly, the courageous but reflective Hamlet is repelled from suicide by the dread uncertainty as to what will be found in that ‘undiscovered country’ whence no traveller returns.—ED., ii.]",
        "M. Mason, Steevens, Dalgleish, Hudson: time] M. MAson: Shakespeare means not only the time that has been, but the time that shall be, recorded.—STEEVENS : ‘Recorded’ is probably here used for recording or recordable, one participle for another.—DALGLEISH: Time, of which a record shall be kept, as opposed to eternity.—Hupson (ed. ii.) : It means simply the last syllable of the record of time. See I, vi, 7; III, iv, 96, for other instances of prolepsis."

Passus xx, Il. 99, 100; ed. Skeat.—ED. ii. ]—CoLLIER : Shakespeare was not the first to apply the epithet ‘dusty’ to death. Anthony Copley, in his Fig for Fortune, 1596, has this line: ‘Inviting it to dusty death’s defeature,’ [p. 55; Sens. Soc. rep.—ED. ii. ].—CLARENDON: Dusky seems too feeble an epithet to describe the darkness of the grave, and we should moreover be very chary of making alterations in the text on account of any apparent confusion of metaphor.",
        "Coleridge, Corson: Out ... Candle] CoLerincE (i, 252) : Alas for Macbeth! now all is inward with him; he has no more prudential prospective reasonings. His wife, the only being who could have had any seat in his affections, dies; he puts on despondency, the final heart- armour of the wretched, and would fain think everything shadowy and unsubstantial, as indeed all things are to those who cannot regard them as symbols of goodness.—[CorRSON (p. 250) : In uttering the words, ‘Out, out, brief candle,’ some actors strike their breasts, as if the reference were to Macbeth’s own light of life, but they should certainly be understood as having reference to the candle of Lady Macbeth’s life. Though commas are used in F,, the words should be uttered with an interrogative intonation, united with that of surprise: ‘Out? out? brief candle?’ (out so soon?) The latter meaning suits better, too, the reflections which follow.—ED. ii.]"

The days gone have not only shown, but abridged, mitigated the journey which we have to make to death. The commentators do not seem to have understood it in this sense.",
        "Hunter: Fooles] HUNTER: Having found in a contemporary writer the word foudes used for crowds, it occurred to me that for ‘fools’ we might read _/ow/es in this sense of crowds, and this led to what may have been the real intention of the Poet. Macbeth, when he hears of the death of his lady, thinks first of the unseasonableness of the time; some time ‘ hereafter’ would have been the time for such a piece of intelligence as this; this introduces the idea of the disposition there is in man to procrastinate in everything; we are forever saying ‘tomorrow,’ and this though we see men dying around us, every ‘ yesterday’ having conducted crowds of human beings to the grave. This introduces more general ideas of the vanity of man, who ‘ walketh in a vain show, and is disquieted in vain,’ a passage of Scripture which seems to have been in the Poet’s mind when he wrote what follows; as is also. ... ‘we spend our years as a tale that is told.’ Shakespeare’s intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures, observable in all his plays, is shewn sometimes in a broad and palpable allusion or adaptation, and sometimes, as here, in passages of which the germ only is in that book. At the same time there is something in this passage partaking of the desperation of the thane’s position, and perhaps intended to shew what thoughts possess a mind like his, burthened with heavy guilt, and having some reason to think retribution near at hand. The word foule for crowd occurs in Archibold’s Evangelical Fruit of the Seraphical Franciscan Order, 1628, MS Harl. 3888, ‘The foule of people past over him in time of sermon,’ f. 81.",
        "Hunter, Clarendon, Birch: Shadow, a poore Player] HunrTer (i, 298, note on Mid. WV. D. V, i, 430, ‘If we shadows have offended’): ‘Shadows’ isa beautiful term by which to express actors, those whose life is a perpetual personation, a semblance but of something real, a shadow only of actual existences. The idea of this resemblance was deeply inwrought in the mind of the Poet and Actor. When, at a later period, he looked upon man again as but ‘a walking shadow,’ his mind immediately passed to the long-cherished thought, and he proceeds: ‘A poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more.’—ED. ii.",
        "Clarendon: Player] CLARENDON: For references to the stage, see I, iii, 144; II, iv, 8, 9; also Zro. and Cress. I, iii, 153.—BIRCH (p. 449): The light of revelation, faith, and hope, according to Shakespeare, have shown us fools the way to dusty death. This life, that Christians humbly imagine gives evidence of the attributes of eternity, signifies nothing, is a tale told by an idiot; and by whom is the tale said to be told but by its maker? How often have we been told by Shakespeare that we are fools, death’s fools, and here we have it repeated with one of the material epithets usually assigned to the end of man—dusty. We have again Jaques’s ‘all the world’s a stage, and all the men are players,’ with parts as brief as at the Blackfriars, or in the Globe on Bankside. There we had the last scene of his sad, eventful history, “sans everything’; but here, of his hopes we have the stern echo of Shakespeare’s materialism, which, like an owl amidst ruins, cries, ‘No more!’ There are three lines of Catullus, which have always been supposed to express his disbelief in a future state, if not his atheism. In this speech of Macbeth’s we have a similarity of idea in the opening line, an exact translation of two words in the second, and the last contains, word for word, the constant expressions, elsewhere, of Shakespeare on Death: ‘Soles occidere et redire possunt, Nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux. Nox est perpetuo una dormienda.’ [Carmina, v,"

Nor has the custom even yet entirely disappeared. We still dedicate—not, indeed, to Phoebus or Diana, but to the Virgin—children who have escaped miraculously, as it is thought, some very imminent danger of death. In strictly Roman Catholic countries such children—easily distinguishable among their playmates by their peculiar, generally entirely white, costume—are very frequently to be met with.—R. P. Harris, M. D. (Tolerance in Pregnant Women, Philadelphia, 1892), has collected upwards of seventeen instances wherein premature birth was due, not to the Cesarean section, but to lacerations by horns of cattle; and suggests that ‘such a casualty may have happened to the mother of Macduff, in view of the fact that several other women have suffered the same form of injury, whose sons, thus liberated, have lived to mature age.’ See also Appendix, p. 399.—ED. ii.]",

There is no cowardice, we say, in his declining the combat under such a conviction. Neither is there any courage in his renewing it; for there is no room for courage in opposing evident fate. But the last word and action of Macbeth are an expression of the moral cowardice which we trace so conspicuously throughout his career; he surrenders his life that he may not be ‘baited with the rabble’s curse.’ 28, 29.

R. G. WHITE; It is possible that Shakespeare, or the stage-manager of his company, did not deny the audience the satisfaction of seeing the usurper meet his doom, and that in the subsequent ‘retreat’ his body was dragged off the stage for its supposed decapitation. See stage- direction, line 70.—DYCE (ed. ii.): The stage-directions given by the Ff in this scene are exquisitely absurd.—CLARENDON: In all likelihood Shakespeare’s part in the play ended here. [The following lines are found in J. P. Kemble’s Acting Copy, 1794, and were added by Garrick: (‘Alarum. They fight. Macbeth falls.) Macb. Tis done! the scene of life will quickly close.

        "Pearle] MALONE: This means thy kingdom's wealth: or rather, ornament. So, Sylvester, England’s Parnassus, 1600: ‘Honor of cities, pearl of kingdomes all,’ [p. 268, ed. Collier, Sonnet on the Peace, iiii—ED. ii.]. Florio, in a Sonnet prefixed to his [Worlde of Wordes], 1598, calls Lord Southampton ‘bright Pearle of Peeres.,—Nares: Anything very valuable, the choice or best part; from the high estimation of the real pearl. In the present case it means the chief nobility.—HUNTER (ii, 201): This is an expression for which it is not easy to account. There is as strange a use of the same word in Sylvester’s Du Bartas, p. 554: ‘These parasites are even the scars and rings (Pearls, said I, perils) in the ears of kings.’ It is possible that Shakespeare might allude to this passage of Sylvester.—WHITE: Rowe’s change was a very proper one, I think. A man may be called a pearl, and many men pearls, par excellence; but to call a crowd of noblemen the pearl of a kingdom is an anomalous and ungraceful use of language.—KEIGHTLEY: ‘Pearl’ is here a collective term,—a singular with a plural sense. The word was often so used.—CLARENDON: Perhaps in the present passage ‘pearl’ is suggested by the row of pearls which usually encircled a crown. 79-94. FLETCHER (p. 168): The omission [on the stage] of Malcolm’s concluding speech seems to us to be alike needless and senseless. Shakespeare knew the art of appropriately closing a drama, no less than that of opening it happily. These lines from the restored prince not only draw together in one point, as is requisite, the several surviving threads of interest, but show.us decisively the predominant impression which the dramatist intended to leave on the minds of his audience. They are like a gleam of evening sunshine, bidding ‘farewell sweet,’ after ‘so fair and foul a day.’—ED. ii."

III, i, 123, ‘This jest shall cost me some expense.’—KEIGHTLEY: With Singer I read make for ‘spend.’ [I have been unable to find this emendation of Singer’s, nor is he credited with it by the Cambridge Editors.— ED.]—CLARENDON: There is no reason to suspect any corruption. The verb governs a cognate accusative, as in Numbers, xxiii, 10, ‘Let me die the death of the righteous.’ Similarly in Rich. II: IV, i, 232: ‘To read a lecture of them.’—BAILEY: I propose excess. Probably the word ‘spend’ occasioned the transcriber or printer to turn excess into ‘expense.’ Since spend may be the corrupt word, my emendation is doubtful. It has little, if any, superiority over one which has just struck me: ‘We shall not suffer a large expense,’ etc., where suffer, as is not uncommon, is a monosyllable."
